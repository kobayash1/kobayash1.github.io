On Monday, my brother was driving in Des Plaines when he was involved in a collision.  Another driver hit him from behind, causing damage to the rear bumper.  All parties involved were fine, and the insurance of the other motorist is covering the repair costs.  Thankfully no one was hurt, but having to send the car to the shop is nevertheless inconvenient.

The Saturday before that, I was working a night shift.  While I was working, without any external stimulus, the right arm of my eyeglasses snapped from the frame.  I don't know if there's any way to repair it.  I'll visit the eyewear shop I bought it from to see if they can do anything for me.  Otherwise, I'll just have to continue wearing my old pair from six years ago.  Surprisingly, they work just fine.
