Haven't posted in a few weeks!  Nothing all that interesting has happened since my last post.  I have a couple ideas running though my head that I want to visit at a later date.  Until I organize my thoughts, I'm going to try and attempt to make regular posts every (other) day.

Lately I've been on this 90's music trip.  Here's a song I remember enjoying on the radio when I was little.  I didn't understand much of the lyrics, let alone the message!  That beat is so catchy, though!
