Week 38 began today.  It was another tough workout and the 165 pound squat at 3x5 still eludes me.  My weight is at 168 pounds.  I'm so close to being able to squat my own body weight!  Hopefully it comes soon.

Without much else to really write about, here are some pictures of food I've taken the past couple of days.

Mojo marinated pork shoulder I roasted this morning.  I'll post a full recipe on it tomorrow.
