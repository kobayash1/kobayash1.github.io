I don't know jack about building websites.  So I'm using this!  The site is hosted by GitHub Pages free of charge.  It's created by [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).  Put simply, jekyll takes text files and performs magic to turn those boring text files into a beautiful website.  Jekyll can take themes, too.  My website is using the "Omega" theme by H.M. Faysal.  He's a cool dude.  It's harder to use than a much more common and streamlined blogging content management system, but it also performs faster and has way less security holes.  I think if I use this long enough (a month or two?) I should feel right at home!
