My brother has a really tasty recipe for chicken stir fry.  I asked him about the ingredients for it today and decided to try my hand at recreating the dish.  The finished product took me more time to reach than I estimated, but I think it turned out okay.  I'll have to think about how I can improve my execution of this chicken stir fry dish to meet and exceed the quality of my brother's.  It's close, but his still tastes better.

The ingredients:

 - chicken breast
 - sliced mushrooms
 - garlic
 - asparagus
 - carrots
 - broccoli
 - crushed red pepper
 - salt
 - pepper
 - flour
 - hoisin sauce
 - oyster sauce
 - sriracha
 - vinegar
 - cooking oil

The sauce used for this dish is 3 parts hoisin sauce, 1 part oyster sauce, 1 part sriracha, and 1.5 parts vinegar.

The chicken breast is diced into cubes, mixed with salt and pepper, and dredged in flour.  Enough cooking oil is added to the wok to cover the bottom.  Two cloves of minced garlic is added to the hot oil.  The chicken is added immediately after the garlic.  Once the chicken is half done, the mushrooms are tossed in.  During this time, the broccoli must be blanched.  Soon after adding the mushrooms, the asparagus and carrots are added.  After blanching, the broccoli is added once everything else is almost finished cooking.  Crushed red pepper and the prepared sauce is added to taste.  Serve over rice.
