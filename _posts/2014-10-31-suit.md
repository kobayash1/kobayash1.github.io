I didn't like the blazer I bought a couple days ago.  I returned it after my workout today and purchased a proper suit.  Normally with price points I can't afford, Jos. A. Bank had a sale today, marking down many of their suits to under $200.  Now with a properly matching suit jacket and dress pants, all that remains is finding a tie to work with my favorite dress shirt.  With my attire settled for my friends' wedding in late November, I wonder what else fate will throw at me to further empty my wallet.
