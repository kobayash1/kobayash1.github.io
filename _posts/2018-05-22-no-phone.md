So my Nexus 5X finally decided to give up.  This has come at something of an inopportune time as I am in a bit of a financial pinch.  I have looked at possible replacements, and the Honor 7X is my likely candidate.  I just have to save cash to buy one.  Until then, I'll have to make do with periodically checking my texts and calls through Google Hangouts on my laptop.  We'll see how this goes.
