This week, I've been scheduled for a couple of night shifts at work.  Both of those fall on workout days (Monday and Wednesday).  With a shift in my workout times from afternoon to morning, I was eager to hit the weights.

Long story short, I failed miserably on most of my workouts.  I couldn't complete one set of squats at 145 pounds, nor even one rep of cable crunches at 72.5 on Wednesday.  While I have lost about 30 pounds since starting my training back in June, it appears that my muscle gain has stalled.  I consulted my bodybuilding friend about my recent lack of progress.  He remarked that 145 pounds is way too light for an average male to be peaking at the squat.  The root of my problem is likely traced to my diet.

My diet has been steady at 2,000 calories per day or less.  And while this diet has allowed me to lose the fat I've lost in such a short time, changes are necessary if I want to continue making gains in strength.  As of today, I've resolved myself to eat more calories and ensure I'm eating at least 150 grams of protein every day.  Hopefully my muscle gain will get back on track by week 14.
