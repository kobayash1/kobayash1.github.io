Lately, I've been eating way less than 2,000 calories per day.  Though it has bolstered my fat loss, it may appear that I am not eating enough protein.  I'm starting to plateau on almost all of my lifts.  Today's workout saw me fail three exercises.  I met my match on the bench press at 125 pounds, failed the barbell shrugs for the first time, and I did not complete the cable crunches for a second consecutive workout.

I may need to increase my daily protein intake to gain muscle mass.  With the increased muscle mass, I will be able to continue progressing with heavier weights on my lifts.  The increased calorie intake, however, will impede my fat loss.  Indeed if I don't closely monitor my incease in caloric intake, I may completely halt my fat loss and even gain fatty tissue.

I've decided I'll put my ego aside and just continue with my workouts and diet as is.  I will fail many exercises, but I will continue to lose fat at the pace I currently am.  After I reach my desired body fat percentage I will begin bulking.  I want to at least get to that six pack before putting weight back on!
