As I struggle to get an instance of Tiny Tiny RSS running on my Raspberry Pi using nginx and postgresql (I'm struggling with getting the right configuration for PHP), I'll post a selfie I took this past Friday when I was at the gym.

I was never fond of taking pictures of myself before I started training.  It's a wonder what physical fitness can do for your confidence.
