Following a productive shift at work today, came a normal series of events involving preparing dinner, making the rounds on the Internet, and conferring with Yosh on what day we will meet at his gym for a training session.  Overall, today seemed to fly by.  In fact, find myself at the time of this writing still with some energy in reserve, but with no desire to pass the time with my usual diversions (video games).  Stricken with a slight case of boredom, I may visit the gym for a quick exercise of Pallof presses which I forgot to perform yesterday.
