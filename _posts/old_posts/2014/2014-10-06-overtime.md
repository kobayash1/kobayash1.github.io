The past few weeks have seen no activity on my blog due to unusually high workloads.  In fact, for the past three weeks I have been working overtime hours.  Today I have a six hour shift after two straight double shifts over the weekend that was preceded by a closing shift Friday night.  Finding time to cook and do laundry has been a challenge, but I have managed to iron my uniform for this morning's shift and eat a proper breakfast.  I'm scheduled for a day off tomorrow, but if trends continue like they have I may end up working then, too.

## Fitness

Week 17 begins today.  Hopefully my workout today goes well despite the reduced amount of sleep I've had over the past few days.
