This morning I awoke with soreness in my triceps, quadriceps, and pectorals.  The pain in the triceps came from the dips, tricep extensions, and close grip bench presses I did yesterday.  Pectoral soreness is the result of bench presses from yesterday as well.  If I think to myself as having these aches being a good thing, I find it motivates me even more.  Simply imagining the new body I could have is enough to let me endure many times more discomfort than today.

This evening, I travelled to my friend's house for a casual set of Mario Kart.  After a couple hours though, I left earlier than my usual time.  Normally, I would game away until about midnight or so before retreating home.  Leaving at 10:30, there was only one place I wanted to visit.  I wanted to go to the gym.

This is the first time I can ever recall myself willing to sacrifice video game time for anything fitness related.  Perhaps I've caught the gym bug?  Maybe catching this gym bug will further motivate me to train hard and dedicate myself to my personal fitness.  Oh boy.

But first, I need rest.  I have another 8 hour shift tomorrow followed by another one on Sunday.  If my schedule for next week mirrors this week's schedule, then I'm in for the start of a long stretch of work.  I can only hope my body can hold on!
