A long day of driving allows my mind plenty of time to wander.  Naturally, thoughts on Linux and fitness assumed major roles in my headspace.  But again, I found myself frequently returning to the subject of my esteemed colleague.  While any plans for a social outing with her are on hold until she decides, I cannot help but allow her to continue pervading my random musings.

I've worked with her at my current job for over a year now.  I will likely never forget this job, as it was the first one I was hired for since high school.  Years later from now, memories of my time there will probably recall my most common shift during the first ten months or so.  Typically during this time, I would serve as cashier for 3 or 4 hours per day.  Starting the job during the less hectic summer days saw me working with only a sparse crew of 5.  With only the five of us serving the entire lunch service on my working days, we developed a sense of familiarity with each other.  Of course, being the outsider, there was an early transitional period in which I needed to find the best fit for myself within the unit.  Eventually however, our minimal crew performed very well, much to the satisfaction of the manager.  One of the five, the manager, has since retired.  Very recently there have been rumblings of another member of my harem, the drive-thru attendant, leaving for a position at another job.

The manager's retirement and the probability of the drive-thru colleague's departure serves as a reminder to me of the ephemeral nature of my position.  Indeed, during my employment, I have seen many other co-workers come and go.  But none of them were part of "my team."  Though I do not have plans to stay at my current job long term, I will still require time to achieve the requirements necessary to apply for positions in Linux server administration.  I wonder which of the three remaining members of the original five will be next to depart.  Regardless of who it may be, there is *one* member of the A-team I wish to maintain close ties with outside of work.

Despite spending the majority of my shifts over the course of 14 months with my colleague, it wasn't until recently when I fell for her.  Intelligent, strong-willed, outwardly kind, and aesthetically vibrant, she possesses all the desirable traits that would attract any man (or woman).  But the thought of pursuing a personal or even platonic relationship with her never occurred to me.  That changed a couple of weeks ago after a discussion we had during some downtime.

After introducing her to this website, we talked about writing.  She disclosed to me a few hints about her background and her journey to where she finds herself now.  One day she hopes to publish a book about her experiences through life.  After remarking that I would definitely enjoy reading her book, I continued forward to focus on my job at hand.  Ever since that point, nary a day has passed without thinking about her at least once.

I want to know more about her.  I want to become a friend of hers.  Of course, I haven't spent enough time with her to know if I want to be *more* than just her friend, but I do want to find out.  Perhaps she will grant me a chance.  Perhaps not.  I will await her decision indefinitely.  However, regardless of her choice to allow me into her circle, I have no choice but to admire her.  And it's about time I realize that.
