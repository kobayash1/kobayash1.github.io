A rare Monday off work afforded me an opportunity to sleep in this morning.  Getting the extra rest certainly helped me in today's workout.  The start of week 7 in my training marked a return to increasing weights after steady weights during the previous week.  Successfully completing all my main lifts while sustaining good form, I'm off to a good start.  Wednesday will be another opportunity to set new personal records, and I am looking forward to it!
