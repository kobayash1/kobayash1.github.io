I started work today eager to finish my shift.  I hadn't been to the gym since Saturday.  Work flew.  A normal flow of lunch time rush followed by a silent lull produced a typical 8 hour shift.

Today was "workout A."  Squats, bench presses, rows, shrugs, curls, hyperextensions, tricep extensions, and cable crunches were all on the agenda for today.  I would believe my workout went fairly decent today.  I completed all the reps required for all but two of the exercises.  However, I may have been a bit conservative on the weights used for the bench presses.  I failed the hyperextensions by just a couple reps, while I think I set the weights way too high on the curls.  I'll have to adjust those in the next workout.

I started doing more online research on general fitness tonight, and found an article on [Nerd Fitness](http://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/2010/02/01/what-burns-more-calories-cardio-intervals-or-weight-training/) that explaied why cardio is virtually useless compared to weight training.  After reading the article, I promptly forwarded it to my friend who recently is quoted as saying "running is the best way to build abs."
