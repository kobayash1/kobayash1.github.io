Week 11 started yesterday after work.  I met my match at 150 pounds on the squat, and set a personal records for 115 on the bench press, 150 on the bent over rows, and 175 on the barbell shrugs.  It's a great feeling to continue improving my personal bests, but the squat is the most important of all my lifts.  Tomorrow I'll go at it with extra fervor in an attempt to keep from having to reduce the weight.

Aesthetically, my body is almost dramatically different from where it was when I started in June.  I've lost a lot of body fat and gained muscle in parts I once had very little.  A few days ago, I stepped on the scale at the gym after my workout.  I weighed in at 175.4 lbs.  Considering I started my training at around 200 pounds, the thought of losing about 25 pounds in just over 10 weeks is astonishing.  The weight loss will inevitably slow down, and indeed I will regain weight as I acquire more muscle mass.  But damn I can't wait until I get to a lean and svelte physique!
