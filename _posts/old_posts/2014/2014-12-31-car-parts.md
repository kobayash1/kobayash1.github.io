Another off day at work gave me a chance to have lunch with a friend I haven't seen in a while.  For the most part, I've lost contact with the greater Chicagoland fighting game community ever since the middle of last year.  I haven't been keeping up with fighting games and honestly, my interest in them has waned greatly.  I have kept my Twitter follows, however, and a few of my friends from fighting game days past I still keep in touch with.

Hiro, an accomplished player in the community, is one of them.  I had lunch with him at the newly opened Tokyo Grill in Roselle.  We had a nice chat, catching up on various things.  After my lunch with him, I went to visit my friend Matt to return his Cards Against Humanity game I had borrowed last week.  On the way home, I dropped by Walmart to buy 5 quarts of Mobil 1 full synthetic oil, an oil filter, and 1 quart of oil stabilizer for my car.  I'll likely bring the car to Feliciano's for him to perform the oil change.

I also bought a couple of Rain-X premium wiper blades.  Earlier this year, perhaps back in February, I purchased a pair of Bosch Icon wiper blades for the car.  Advertised as producing streak-free clarity and able to perform equally well in snowy and icy conditions, I figured they would be perfect for the typical Chicago winters when snow and ice accumulation make regular multi-point pressure wipers useless.  They worked as billed until both blades started streaking heavily last month.  I paid good money for those!  If I get similar results using these Rain-X brand blades, I'll just go back to cheap Anco wipers and deal with the ice interference as before.

Also, happy new year everyone!
