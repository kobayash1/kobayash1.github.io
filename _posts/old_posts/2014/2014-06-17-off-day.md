With no work today and no workout scheduled either, I took the liberty of napping for another 3 hours after awakening this morning at 8 by habit.  I spent the rest of the day reading fitness articles on the Internet.  I learned quite a bit aboout various fitness topics and found one exercise in particular (the Pallof press) interesting enough that I am now considering adding it to my training regimen.  I also tracked my first day of meals on [My Fitness Pal](http://myfitnesspal.com) today in an effort to keep specific count of calorie intake every day.

Tomorrow will be another 8 hour shift plus workout, which I will be totally ready for!
