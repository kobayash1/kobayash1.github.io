After taking a rest week for week 28, I began week 29 yesterday.  I anticipated having a hard time picking up where I left off, possibly failing all my lifts.  To my pleasant surprise, I was actually able to set a new personal record for my bench press at 135 pounds!  Though I failed pretty miserably on the squats, I did well on the other exercises.  Also, I added glute bridges 3x10 to my routine.  I started with only the bar, but already I'm feeling faint soreness today that I haven't experienced from doing squats.  No pain, no gain!
