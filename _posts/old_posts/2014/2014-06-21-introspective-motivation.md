Another typical day at work led to more fitness research online.  Text exchanges throughout the afternoon with Yosh regarding diet and other items supplemented my ongoing fitness education.  Through exploring myriad health and fitness topics, I recalled a question my mother posed me yesterday.  She asked why I had suddenly chosen to exercise regularly and be more conscious of my eating habits.  I gave her a quick response, citing my brother as inspiration.  Today, however, found myself pondering my own motives for this newfound interest in fitness.

Ultimately, I want to get ripped and go from there.  Being a complete beginner, I am in a unique position where I can lose body fat and gain muscle at the same time.  Long time fit bodies with lean muscle and low body fat can typically only choose one or the other.  Though I am not in that position now, I am certainly aiming to be soon.  But why am I pursuing a lean and muscular build?  Yes, the fitness lifestyle involves plenty of exact science and the sheer size of the knowledge base presents a wealth of information to internalize.  Because the path to achieving personal fitness can have a near infinite amount of possible routes, being able to nerd out on the possibilites for oneself appeals very strongly to someone like me.  But that certainly is not all.

There is something to be said about aesthetics.  I don't claim to be an expert on the human psyche, but I wouldn't disagree with notions that one's appearance has a tangible effect on the impressions of others.  The old adage that claims "beauty is in the eye of the beholder" is dependent upon the beholder.  When said beholder is one raised in my current society, certain traits and characteristics of the human body are normally associated with the idea of "beauty."  Historic paintings dating many centuries ago depict "beautiful" women in public baths.  Their physiques are drawn in a manner that one of the 21st century would call "fat."  Anyone living in the modern world today can identify many of the anatomical features that people find attractive.

So why all of a sudden am I working for a six pack now?  Am I influenced by my peers?  It is true that a few of my friends have either long been actively fit or recently started on their journeys of personal fitness.  But I've had fit friends before without feeling any urge to pursue fitness myself.  Am I trying to impress girls?  There *may* be someone who currently has my attention, but I've had crushes before in high school and college without ever considering building up biceps.  Though confidence has usually not been an issue for me, being able to have more of it as a result of diet and training certainly wouldn't hurt.

In all honesty, my motivations can likely be attributed to a combination of all those factors.  I want to compete with my peers, and I would enjoy more attention from members of the opposite sex.

Today and tomorrow are off days in my workout regimen.  I can't wait for the next workout on Monday.
