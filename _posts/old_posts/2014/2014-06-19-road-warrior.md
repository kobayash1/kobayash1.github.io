Thursday brings another round of home health visits.  Straying from the norm, however, were two admissions:  one in Mount Prospect, a suburb northwest of Chicago and one in Plainfield, the opposite direction of the former.  With our usual patients concentrated on the south side of Chicago, our itinerary drawn on a map forms a large triangle of death.  We started the day at 5:20 AM.  The time struck 7:30 PM upon arrival at home.  Of course, having finished the first few patients well before 9 AM, with the next patient due at noon, we had no choice but to kill time at Horseshoe in Hammond, IN.  Needless to say, driving from Elgin, to Hammond, to Mount Prospect, to Plainfield, then back to Elgin is quite the adventure for one day.  Throw in traffic congestion.

I'm just glad I'm home.  My brother is buying dinner for tonight.  He's amazing.

## Work

After no large amount of consideration, I believe I have arrived at a reasonable course of action regarding the colleague occupying my idle thoughts as of late.  Though I haven't put much thought into the possible outcomes, I am resolved to follow through regardless of the effects of my action.  The only question that remains is when to execute.  Likely soon.
