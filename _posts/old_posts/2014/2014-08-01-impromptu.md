Scheduled for a 4 hour shift at work today, I received a call from the manager on duty giving me the day off.  While enjoying a day off with no other plans set is relaxing, being given a day off without advance notice often creates boring scenarios like today.  Having nothing else to do, I took the opportunity today to get started on my free online linux course.  I breezed past the first four chapters while doing laundry.

The final workout of week 7 proceeded my studies.  I decided to be conservative with the choice in weights for most of my exercises before starting back up on the linear progression next week.  As a result, my form was clean throughout all the exercises and I completed all the sets properly.  With the exception of the hyperextensions, which I failed miserably, I plan on increasing resistance across all my exercises next week.  The opportunity will be a good confidence booster to start the next week, as this week has been fairly rough on my morale.  I'll expand on those trials in perhaps tomorrow's entry.
