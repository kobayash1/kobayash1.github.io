The news lately about a treasure trove of private and intimate photos taken by high profile celebrities leaked out to the mainstream internet sparked some discussion about security on the news sites and blogs I follow.  I'll admit I don't change my passwords often enough, but I am savvy enough to use different passwords across all accounts that require one.  On top of that, I enable two-factor authentication whereever possible.

My Gmail, personalized e-mail, online banking, Dropbox, Github (and consequently this website), and Twitter accounts all something I know (my password) and something I have (my cell phone).  Of course, two-factor authentication is only as strong as the implementation behind it.  There are numerous stories out there in the past of two-factor authentication being bypassed thanks to poor implementation (PayPal).  The current discourse of security spurred me on to analyze other accounts I may have across forums and such.  I'll have to look into my domain name registrar and a couple of other internet accounts to make sure they're secure as well.

## Fitness

As I am starting to recover from my cold, I'll mark Monday's workout as missed and adjust my weights accordingly for tomorrow's workout.  Hopefully I'll be as healthy tomorrow as I anticipate.
