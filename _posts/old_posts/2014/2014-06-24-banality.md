The morning began with a few errands to run for my mom.  Afterward, house cleaning was in order.  Lunch was sparse and lean, with a couple chicken tenders and an apple.  I spent the remainder of the afternoon playing a new game for Linux I purchased yesterday:  *XCOM: Enemy Unknown*.  *XCOM* is a turn-based combat strategy game that originally released for Windows a year or two ago.  It's a pretty fun game.  I have not yet tried multiplayer, but the single player campaign is fairly engaging.

I decided to take a nap after a couple hours of *XCOM*, and woke up many hours later at 8 PM.  These off days (work and workout) are incredibly boring.
