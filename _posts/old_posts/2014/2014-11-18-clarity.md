I had a small opportunity yesterday to lift some of the burden I've been under the past few days.  I made proper amends with the person I wronged and she replied to me with all I needed to hear.  With this sense of clarity, my spirits are much higher and definitely more positive.

I don't know if you're reading this.  But if you are, you know that what I am about to say is for you.

> I truly am grateful for your caring.  I know you care because I would not be where I am now if you didn't.  I could even be unemployed if not for your intervention.  I will be certain to never betray your trust again.  The next time you see me I will be back to my old self, leaving behind my aloof and reclusive persona of the past three days.  But I will be improved.  In all the ways we discussed in the recent days.  I promise you that.
