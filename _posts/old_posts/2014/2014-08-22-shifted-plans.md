With no time yesterday to get in my second workout of the week, I made the decision to skip it and get back on schedule with my third workout originally scheduled for today.  I adjusted weights accordingly and managed to perform pretty well, all things considered.  This is now the end of week 10, and so far I have missed only 2 of 30 scheduled workouts.  I plan on only increasing the intensity from this point onward.  I'm happy with the progress I've made thus far, but I am more eager to work towards ever more progress in my body sculpting.
