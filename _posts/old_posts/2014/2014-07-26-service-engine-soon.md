With yesterday being much busier than I had initially anticipated, my plans to shop around after work fell through.  Similarly, I had an impromptu family outing for dinner tonight as well.  Perhaps I will have a better opportunity tomorrow to shop for fragrances.

## Cars

The service engine soon lamp lit up on the truck dashboard today.  After our dinner at a small restaurant in Niles, I drove over to the local AutoZone to get a free computer reading.  The error code we received indicated that something may be wrong with the oxygen sensor.  I will have to bring it to my local mechanic in the morning for him to have a closer examination.  Hopefully any necessary repair won't be too extensive.  Feliciano, my mechanic, was once referred to me by a family friend a few years ago.  He always does a great job and offers repair prices significantly lower than the average dealership garage.  We're indeed very lucky to know him as he has already performed numerous repairs on our cars, saving us untold amounts of money.
