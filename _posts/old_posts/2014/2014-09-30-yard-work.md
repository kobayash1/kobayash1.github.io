A day off from work presented me with some yard responsibilities I've been delaying.  The big tree in my front yard has already shed about half of its leaves, while other trees on my block are still mostly green.  I welcome the early leaf fall as it gives me the opportunity to clean up the mess before the climate becomes much colder.
