The first of three consecutive days off work was mostly spent out and about.  My mom wanted to shop for some merchandise at the fashion outlets in Rosemont.  The drive there was brisk, with little traffic after the morning rush.  Not finding what she wanted, we trekked back to Woodfield.  While she continued her search for goods, I took the opportunity to try out some clothes elsewhere.

For many years now I have worn pants with a 36 inch waist size.  However, with my current diet and exercise habits continuing now for over four weeks, I've had to fasten my belt progressively tighter on my favorite jeans.  I've now reached a point where my work belt cannot be fastened any tighter.

I sauntered about the various casual pants offerings at Macy's and found a couple of styles to my liking.  I fitted some jeans in 34 and 32 inch sizes.  Though I ultimately didn't purchase anything, it was a satisfying experience to fit into a pair of pants 4 inches smaller than what I have been wearing for a long time.

I've made noticeable and measurable progress in my personal fitness, and I can't wait to reach my more long term goals!  Today's shopping adventures only bolster my motivation to get ripped!
