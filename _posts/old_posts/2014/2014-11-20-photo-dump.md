Not really having much to write about, I'll use this post to show a few pictures I've taken in the past few days.  I don't have a fancy DSLR camera, but my Nexus 5 will suffice for my amateur photography!  Buying such an expensive camera would be a waste anyway, as all I ever take pictures of is mostly food!
