Most, if not all, of the tech sites I follow have been following the news on net neutrality very closely.  There are various movements across the Internet and many other avenues to try and increase awareness of the issue.  The information given on [Battle For the Net](http://battleforthenet.com) is a good place to catch up.  The video with John Oliver they link towards the bottom is a quick and easy way to grasp the basis of the problem.

In essence, Internet service providers are trying to introduce a concept of Internet "fast lanes."  These companies can then charge content providers (websites) money to have their content delivered on the "fast lane," or be subject to using the "slow lane."  This, in effect, creates tolls that not everyone can afford to pay and leads to an inequal Internet where not all sites load as fast as others.

I've installed a widget to my site that will show a banner on September 10 to raise awareness and encourage action.  If you would like to see it now, simply reload the site [here](http://chrisbayot.com/#SHOW_BFTN_WIDGET).
