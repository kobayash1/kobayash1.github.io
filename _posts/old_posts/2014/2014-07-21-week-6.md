An unusually slow day at work left me with plenty of energy for today's workout.  Failing sets is becoming more common as weights continue to get progressively heavier.  I haven't reached a plateau yet, however, so I will continue to train as hard as I can.  If I reach a point where I can no longer increase weight resistance across many of my exercises, I may have to change my diet to increase calories.  Such changes are a long way down the road however.

Despite only having completed 5 weeks of my training regimen, I've made considerable progress in changing my body.  I'm starting to notice muscular features that I never noticed before.  Times like these I wish I had taken more pictures of myself before starting my training.  Often times I'll see a noticeable change and wonder if I simply never noticed it or if my physique really is undergoing such tangible changes.  Nevertheless, noticing curves I never had before is very exciting.  The experience overall has been thus far very motivating and has greatly boosted my confidence.

I can't wait to see where I'll be after another 5 weeks.
