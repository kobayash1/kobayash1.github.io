The pain in my left quadriceps nagged at me less severely today than yesterday.  However it's persistence was a legitimate cause for concern going into my workout today.  At the gym today was some hard-bodied gentleman apparently of Hispanic descent using the squat rack when I arrived.  Needing the rack for two of my exercises for today, I proceeded to conduct my workout in reverse order from my normal routine.

I managed to successfully complete all my workouts that did not require the use of the squat rack.  The cable crunches have been steadily increasing in resistance, as I have yet to fail that exercise.  Monday will see an attempt to perform 3 sets of 10 with 100 pounds of resistance.  That will be very interesting.

Completing all the exercises before squats only created more anxiety.  A few repetitions of bodyweight squats served as my warmup as the squat rack had been newly vacated.  I still felt occasional twangs of pain coming up from the squat.  However, after the first few warmup sets, the pain appeared to lessen in intensity.  Indeed, I was able to complete all 5 sets of 5 reps with 60 pounds of weight.  In fact, I feel even better as of this writing than I did before the squat exercises.  The new test to squat 65 pounds 5x5 awaits me on Monday.

The reward for having completed my workout?  Coming home to cut the grass.  I hope I have the energy required for tomorrow's 8 hour shift!
