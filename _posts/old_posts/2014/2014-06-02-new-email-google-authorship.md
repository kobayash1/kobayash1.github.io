Using zoho mail, I've finally set up my own personal email address at chris at chrisbayot dot com!  I'll probably auto-forward all of its incoming messages to my Gmail.  I already set up my Gmail account to be able to send mail as chris at chrisbayot dot com.

I also set up Google Authorship.  Now digging up my blog posts Google should add a by line in the search results.  Kinda like this:

<figure>
     <a href="{{ site.url }}/images/authorship_example.png"> <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/authorship_example.png"></a>
     <figcaption>Now I need to figure out SEO...</figcaption>
</figure>
