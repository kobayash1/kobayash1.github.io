I purchased a Raspberry Pi model B+ last week, and in anticipation of its arrival, I've been researching how to set up the various server-side applications I have planned for it.  One such service is mpd.

Music Player Daemon, or 'mpd' for short, is a low resource music playing server application.  It's old, highly versatile, and considerably more complex to configure than a typical media player.  Music Player Client, or mpc for short, is the client-side program that controls mpd.  I spent a good portion of my night after work figuring out how to get mpd/mpc up and running locally on my desktop.

I've got the basics down and I am now enjoying some tunes with it.  Because mpc is cli-based, applying some linux-fu can make mpd very versatile.  I'll play around with it to explore some of its more powerful features.

Here is a one line command that searches for a given artist in the music database, adds all the search results to the current playlist, shuffles the playlist, and starts playback:

<pre><code>$ mpc search artist PSY | mpc add && mpc shuffle && mpc play</code></pre>

Can't wait to figure out how to add internet radio as the source!
