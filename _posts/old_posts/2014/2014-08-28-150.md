Yesterday was another attempt at the 150 pound squats.  I failed even quicker than I did on Monday's try!  A reduction in weight by 10% to 135 pounds will be in order for tomorrow.

After today's patient visits, I spent some time catching up with my neglected news feeds and YouTube subscriptions.  I learned that the Linux Foundation is now offering their own line of Linux certifications.  Two certifications, to be exact.  Consensus around the Internet is that they may prove to be valuable in the future, as their exams are much more practical than the multiple choice fare of the LPIC-1 and 2, but the the RedHat certs still remain the standard among today's companies looking to hire Linux talent.  Hopefully I can finish my studies for the RHCSA and RHCE soon!
