I had a nice conversation with Yosh yesterday regarding more diet and fitness info.  He suggested I try to cook every meal I eat.  Indeed, buying pre-cooked food is more expensive than cooking your own, but his idea was that tracking your caloric intake accurately and staying committed to personal fitness greatly benefit from the discipline earned through cooking your own meals.  So I decided from today onward I will make a much more concerted effort to prepare my own meals instead of springing for fried chicken tenders at Jewel.

Oddly enough, I had a taste for beef broccoli.  On the drive home from work, I stopped by the local grocery store to pick up sesame oil, oyster sauce, broccoli, and 1.5 pounds of beef flank steak.  I found a [recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBG90Ey_BPY) on Youtube for an authentic Chinese style beef broccoli the night before.  Upon arriving home, I prepared the ingredients then headed to the gym.

Today's workout was killer.  Most of the exercises I performed today saw weight resistance increased from the last workout.  I had been able to keep up for the past 4 workouts, but today saw a sort of normalization as the resistance finally caught up from my lower starting points.  I failed squats, bench presses, and tricep extensions for the first time.  Each of those exercises reached a fail point within the last set.  I may still have a chance to redeem myself the next workout, otherwise I'll have to reduce weights.  As a result of finally pushing weights that pushed back at me, I was utterly exhausted immediately after my Pallof presses.  I sat on a bench, barely able to catch my breath.  It felt like I was on the brink of fainting.  I was able to recover quickly however, and after some much needed water I started back home.

After an immediate double scoop protein shake, I began cooking.  I followed the Youtube video step by step, but with some liberties taken in regards to measurements.  Upon completion, I sat down at the table without even having tasted the beef broccoli.  The dish would either be delicious or repugnant.  Much to my pleasant surprise, it was *absolutely amazing*.  Perhaps this whole notion of cooking isn't so difficult afterall.

My colleague whom I've written about in recent entries has a certain affinity for Chinese fare.  She once asked me if I could cook egg drop soup for her on Mother's Day, to which I retorted that I am not Chinese.  Perhaps I may cook this dish for her to taste.  I'm certain she would enjoy it.
