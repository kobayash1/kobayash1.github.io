When I woke up this morning with lingering soreness in my quadriceps, I knew it was going to be a long day.  I could have easily fallen down the stairs this morning if not for the handrails.  Thankfully, the 8 hour shift at work today seemed to fly by.  I was fairly productive at work, despite having some help with a couple of my duties.  I performed adequately enough to gain what little favor I received from the new shift manager.  In reference to my performance today, he remarked that I was "above average."  I'll definitely accept that as a huge compliment considering many days I perform way less than average.

My first try at "Workout B" in my training regimen followed shortly after work.  Feelings of uncertainty rang around my head travelling to the gym.  My legs were still jelly.  Despite the uneasiness, I still was very eager to test myself and determine whether I could complete today's workout.  The first exercise:  45 lbs. squat, 5 sets 5 reps.

A warmup of bodyweight squats served as the pre-workout routine.  Even without any added weight, I could feel burning sensations I've never before felt in my quadriceps.  However, I pushed myself hard, and by some miracle, I was able to complete all the repetitions required for the exercise!  My reward:  a 5 pound weight increase for Friday's session.  In fact, excluding the hyperextensions from Monday, I'll be adding weight across all my exercises since I successfully completed all of their reps as well.  Hyperextensions will have to stay at 25 lbs. until I can complete that 2x10 exercise.

## Food

Apparently, mushrooms have a short shelf life.  To my dismay, I opened the fridge this evening to find spoiled mushrooms.  I guess I'll just have to cook them immediately after buying them from now on.
