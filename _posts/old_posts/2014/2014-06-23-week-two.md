Today began the second week of my weight training regimen.  After only one week, I have already started to notice signs of change.  This morning, the furthest notch from the buckle was required to fasten my belt.  I had noticeably more energy at work.  These and a couple other peculiarities I've noticed did nothing but boost my confidence.  I can only imagine the total progress three more weeks from now, two months from now, and further on.

With my success in completing most of my exercises comes the need to increase weight resistance with every workout.  Today was the first time I struggled completing the squat workout at my new 55 pound resistance.  On Wednesday, I will increase the challenge another five pounds.  Failing the barbell curls and military presses, I succeeded at all the other workouts.  They too will see an increase in resistance the next session.  The curls and military presses will stay at their current weights.

Today was also my first opportunity to try my new protein powder as a post-workout supplement.  The taste of it was surprisingly pleasant.  This is a vital routine I can easily become accustomed to.  Always motivated by my ultimate goal, I continue to march forward with vigor.
