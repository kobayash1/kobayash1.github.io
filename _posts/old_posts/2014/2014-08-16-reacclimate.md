After an unusually slow Saturday at work, I spent most of my afternoon and evening catching up with my phone.  Being the nerd I am, I am somewhat of a power user of the Android platform.  I use many different apps most users never use and I have very discerning settings and personalizations I apply to my phone.  Having operated with a completely barebones phone the past few days to try and debug the crashing problems I was experiencing, it took the better part of my day at home to re-organize my Nexus 5.

Some of the apps I use include Authenticator, Wakelock Detector, WiFi ADB, Zooper, JuiceSSH, Syncthing, and Terminal Emulator, just to name a few.  One may consider me fairly security conscious and somewhat of a tech geek.  This time last year, I had never owned a smartphone.  But as I approach the one year anniversary of my Nexus 5, I've taken the complete plunge into utilizing all the advantages my device can provide.
