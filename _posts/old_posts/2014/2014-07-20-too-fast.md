For the past few days I've been eating more takeout than cooking my own meals.  I've managed to keep within my caloric intake goals, but I really should develop the habit of cooking for myself.  For this week, I will attempt to eat nothing but food I prepared.  Tomorrow I will do some grocery shopping after my workout.  Preceeding the workout, however, is another 8 hour shift at work.

I wonder what new recipes I should teach myself this week.  Perhaps I'll look to my colleague for ideas.  It may lead to another opportunity to cook for her if the dish turns out delicious.
