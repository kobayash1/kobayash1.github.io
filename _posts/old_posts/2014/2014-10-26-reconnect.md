Yesterday after an extended shift at work, I went to a friend's house for a board game & Technika gathering.  I probably spent too much time there, as I ended up getting only 5 hours of sleep that night before work today.  It was worth the lost sleep to catch up with some old friends I had not seen in a while, though.

Tomorrow I'll begin week 20 of my weight training.  Tonight, I'll watch the latest episode of *Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works*.  I don't recall exactly what year it was when I stopped watching anime by the seasons.  It has been at least a few years.  However, whenever there is a new anime adaptation of TYPE-MOON's property I cannot resist.  Thus far, this series seems to be meeting or exceeding the high expectations set for it.  ufotable's production is top shelf as anticipated.  *UBW* will probably end up being just as great as ufotable's *Fate/Zero* was two years ago.  These episodes can't arrive soon enough!
