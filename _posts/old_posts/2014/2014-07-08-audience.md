I have a sneaking suspicion that the colleague holding the other end of my heartstrings has been indeed keeping up with my blog.  I have yet to translate the confession I wrote in *[Realization](http://chrisbayot.com/2014/realization)* into plain conversational English, but even if I can find the right words, finding an adequate opportunity proves more challenging.  Time is a scarce resource while on the clock, and using it optimally and efficiently is key to performing well at my job.  Besides, getting all my thoughts off my chest in the work environment would seem forced and contrived.  Almost any scenario outside of work would be appropriate for me to properly spill my thoughts.  Such an opportunity, however, will have to be created by my colleague and likely will not be decided upon until after her summer classes.

The wait, if not killing me, is certainly weighing heavily on my mind every day.  Thankfully I can turn to my personal fitness and other hobbies to keep my mind preoccupied.
