With work ramping up the past few days due to the holiday rush, I haven't had much time to write blog posts.  Today, however, I have a chance to write about some bathroom repairs I was able to perform without having to pay for costly professional service.

The shower had been unable to spray hot water the past few days.  However, all the other faucets in the house worked just fine.  I called over a friend to take a look at it and determine if our problem could be an easy fix.  When he arrived, he removed the siding panel to expose the pipes.  What we saw as all copper pipes positioned behind the wooden support beams.  My friend explained that since all the pipes were copper, the fix would require cutting the spout off and soldering on a new one.  Such a repair was out of his expertise, but he told me he knew a plumber who could come and do the repairs a few days later.

The next day, I searched the Internet for answers to my problem.  I found that reports of the same kind of symptoms (no hot water) were usually the cause of a worn out pressure balancing unit.  I also found a few videos online detailing exactly how to remove and replace the mixer cap and balancing unit.  After a short trip to the local hardware store, I performed the repair myself in under 30 minutes.  Stick it, expensive plumber guy!
