Tomorrow is the beginning of my training.  I have much to learn about fitness and myself.  This will be a trying journey, but one I am eager to undertake.  But first, work.  I'll need plenty of sleep.

Also, one of my colleagues has been progressively invading more of my thought processes lately.  I wonder if it's something I should take into consideration and possibly determine a resolution for.
