An off day at work presented me with numerous chores to perform at home.  With my brother on duty today, all of the housekeeping tasks were left to me.  I spent the better part of the day swiffering, sweeping, dusting, wiping countertops, folding clothes, and ironing my work pants.

With the house clean and the laundry done, I contacted my friend to inquire about his availability for tonight.  Free of any obligations, he and his fiancee invited me over for some Technika while we watched the Falcons destroy the Buccaneers on Thursday Night Football.  My friend used this opportunity to present me an invitation to his wedding in November.  I'll RSVP shortly, but now I am confronted with the issue of acquiring formalwear that actually fits me.

The last occasion that asked dress clothes of me was well before I started my weight training.  None of my current pairs of dress slacks fit me well.  I'll have to set aside some time (and money) to shop for a nice ensemble.
