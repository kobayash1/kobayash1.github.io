Scheduled for an 8 hour shift at work today, I mistakenly thought the start of my shift would be at 10 AM this morning.  Awakened by a phone call shortly after 8, I immediately hurried to work.  Despite arriving half an hour later than scheduled, I still managed to perform most if not all of my required tasks.  Incidentally, I don't think I've worked many 8 hour shfits as efficiently as I did today.  My tardiness was enough of an impetus to work as fast as I did.  Now I will have an opportunity to match if not exceed my performance tomorrow, as I have another identical shift.

Working with the added stress and higher tempo naturally led to some profuse perspiration.  After finishing up at work, I arrived home ready to shower and relax.  Unfortunately, I forgot that I had to cut the grass this afternoon.

Summer around these parts has largely never arrived this year.  I cannot recount any stretch of multiple days over the past few months where the high temperature exceeded 90 degrees.  Our summer has been relatively cool.  Today, however, the high was 90, with a humidity of over 60%.

By the time I had finished cutting the grass, my shirt was almost too heavy to remove.  With a very large glass of iced water by my side, writing this blog entry shall bring a well-deserved end to my night!
