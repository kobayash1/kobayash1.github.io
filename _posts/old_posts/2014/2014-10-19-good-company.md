My friend and colleague at work offered me some advice the other day.  What she shared with me was very profound and greatly lifted my spirits.  I don't know if I can properly express how blessed I am to know someone like her.  I'm quite speechless, actually.  But when I find the right words I'll be sure to write.

After my rest week, I went into Tuesday's workout with full confidence.  The next two days left me with very sore legs.  As a result, I moved the second workout to Friday, and skipped workout three.  Thankfully, the muscle soreness after Friday was considerably less intense.  I purchased some protein powder from the nearby GNC immediately after Friday's workout and my recovery seems to have sped up.  Heading into week 19, I should be back in top form for three workouts per week.  Let the gains continue!
