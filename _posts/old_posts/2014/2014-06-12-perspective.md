I had a nice conversation with my bodybuilding friend Yosh over the phone tonight.  Naturally, we chatted over our newfound common interest in fitness.  With myself playing the fresh neophyte, and him portraying the grizzled veteran, I gave Yosh an opportunity to speak his mind on the matter.  In what seemed like a rehearsed monologue that he definitely had practice performing for others, Yosh spilled many of the intricacies of his knowledge in physical fitness like a waterfall.  Jumping from one topic to the other, I felt he could continue his diatribe forever.  He clearly wasn't rambling, though.

It's been a long time since I engaged in a such a one-way conversation where I was able to centralize so much information on a subject I know nothing about.  It actually felt really refreshing to just shut up, let Yosh talk, and take notes.  He answered all my questions thoroughly, though not necessarily in a concise manner.  We explored a gamut of concepts ranging from the difference between bodybuilding and powerlifting, to why cardio is useless, all while he spewed fitness jargon like "hypertrophy" and "progressive overloading."  He disclosed enough wisdom to easily overwhelm any novice, but since I follow him and others like him on Twitter, I wasn't completely lost when Yosh began delving deeper into technical explanations.

After examining various more aspects of fitness and answering more of my beginner questions, we arrived on the idea of short-term and long-term goals.  Being completely frank, I told Yosh that I had not really planned far enough into the future to develop any long-term goals.  Really, I just want to lose my belly, build some muscle, and stay that way.  Totally understanding of my shallow viewpoint, he reiterated a point he made earlier.  "Train hard, get rest, watch what you eat, and have fun."  Ready, eager, and able!

One thing that struck me in particular is how toward the end of our call, he really emphasized the importance of having fun during the process of personal fitness.  He remarked that it's not worth doing if you're not having fun and that indeed he too, would not be where he is currently if he wasn't having fun.  I found this kind of attitude reminiscent of a similar stance I would take as a seasoned tournament fighting game player.

Whenever a fighting game player (typically a noob) would ask me for advice on switching from a conventional controller, or "pad," to joystick, I would always be more than willing to entertain their questions to the best of my ability.  Inevitably, the interested party would ask so many questions about using a stick over a pad, that I would recommend they simply dive in and try it.  However, I would typically offer one caveat.  I ensured that every time I helped someone looking to transition from pad to joystick I would emphasize to the player that he/she should just commit to using whichever method is most comfortable.  For those unfamiliar, often times players in a social setting would experience some kind of pressure--logistic or social--to use a joystick instead of a conventional controller.  Sometimes I would find a player who had made the switch to joystick perform less efficiently than when he/she was using a pad.  I wonder what stories of others' disappointment and frustration Yosh had experienced in his pursuit of gains...

On an unrelated note, I purchased *Sid Meier's Civilization V* on Steam yesterday.  It was 65% off and it had just been released for Linux that day.  I tried playing it tonight, but I quit shortly after starting.  *Civilization V* seems like a pretty complicated game that demands a slightly more significant time investment to learn properly.  Perhaps I'll play over the weekend.  Instead of learning *Civ V* tonight, I decided I would write this blog post.  :)
