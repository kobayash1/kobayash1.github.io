Scheduled for an 8 hour shift on Saturday, lunch service proved to be quite busy.  Ultimately, I stayed an extra half hour to perform more duties.  My manager, however, asked me if I would be interested in working a closing shift at another location in Crystal Lake, 30 minutes north of our restaurant.  Initially, I was hesitant.  I was scheduled for another 8 hour shift the next morning, afterall.  In the end, I decided to work the extra 6+ hours.

At Crystal Lake, I reunited with a former manager to help with another particularly busy shift.  Working the whole day from 8 AM  to past 11 PM without a break surprisingly was not all that tiring.  I finally arrived home close to midnight and was able to get enough sleep to perform well for today's lunch shift.  Overall, the experience in a different environment was enjoyable and definitely worthwhile when considering I will be paid overtime!  I'll be sure to jump at further opportunities for extra hours.
