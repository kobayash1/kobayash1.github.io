My training regimen continued today with the start of week 25.  I failed the squats and bench presses at 145 and 135 pounds respectively, but they weren't too far off from being successful.  Hopefully I can finally squat 145 at 5x5 by Friday.

This Saturday, the sixth, will mark the 6 month anniversary of when I started lifting.  I will likely post another progression pictorial then.  My body has changed so much!
