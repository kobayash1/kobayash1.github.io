This evening, I watched a match of tennis on television.  It was a US Open quarterfinal matchup between Roger Federer and Gael Monfils, two of my favorite tennis players to watch.  The match lasted the full 5 sets with Federer winning three straight after dropping the first two.  I only played tennis once or twice this year.  My fitness training started quite a while after that, too.  With my current weight 30 pounds less than what it was last I played tennis, I've developed an itch to get back to the court.

I wonder how my tennis game will benefit from my newfound physical fitness.  Perhaps I'll bug my brother about playing a few sets before the days of temperate climate run out.
