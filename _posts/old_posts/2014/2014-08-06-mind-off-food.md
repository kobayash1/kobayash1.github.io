I grew up typically forgoing breakfast every day.  As a result, missing breakfast is not as large an issue to me as it may be for others.  Actually having breakfast, however, does help improve my overall cognition for the rest of the day.  Indeed, with my shorter work shifts as of late, I have been indulging myself to high calorie breakfast sandwiches at the nearby McDonald's.

With my 4 hour work shift starting at 11 today, I still awoke at 8 despite the opportunity to sleep in.  Eating nothing at home, and resisting the temptation of a fatty sausage sandwich, I managed to consume zero calories until my post-workout protein shake just before 6.  Combined with my dinner of pork ribs and about a cup and a half of white rice, I easily met my under 2,000 calorie intake goal for today.

Though it may not be the healthiest way to "hit my macros," distracting my thought processes away from food while keeping busy at work is significantly easier than continuously resisting hunger on off days.  Another reason to enjoy work, I suppose.
