I visited some friends in Glencoe last night.  On the way there, I passed the Chicago Botanical Garden.  It was nighttime, so the garden was closed.  However, there stand two tall trees at the entrance to the park, each adorned with hundreds, if not thousands of lights.  It's a beautiful sight.  On the way back home, I took a couple pictures.
