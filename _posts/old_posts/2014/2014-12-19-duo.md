This past week, I conducted my workouts with a friend.  I had a seven-day guest pass laying around, so I let him use it.  Having someone to spot on bench presses and match on my various lifts helped a great deal in putting more effort in my workouts.  I tried harder in my lifts this week than I have in previous weeks.  I can only attribute that to having a training buddy present to challenge me and provide help and advice.  This is good, since I've been hitting a plateau on some of my exercises as of late.  Hopefully I can finally start to breakthrough!
