I decided to take a one week rest period for Week 17.  So today began Week 18 with slightly reduced weights for all my workouts.  I did fairly well, but most surprising was that I had lost about six pounds since the last time I visited the gym.  I thought I was actually eating too much during my rest week, but apparently not!  Hopefully that's mostly fat that was burned off.  I hope by the end of Week 24 my rectus abdominus will finally be visible.  Just have to keep on workin'!

## Work

Speaking of work, apparently I logged in over 28 hours of overtime through the last pay period for a total of over 108.  I can't expect anything like that again, but I will not hesitate to accept more opportunities for extra hours.  Such opportunities might not be as readily available going forward after my boss expressed concern over me possibly experiencing burnout.  Frankly, the thought of quitting from working too much never crossed my mind.  I would gladly work another 108 hours in two weeks!
