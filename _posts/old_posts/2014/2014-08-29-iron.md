Work flew by today, as did my workout.  Monday will be the start of week 12.  I plan on updating my before and after pictorials at the conclusion of week 12.  Not much else of note happened today.  I did laundry yesterday but was too lazy to iron my work pants.  During dinner prep tonight, I took the opportunity to finally get that done.

I had neglected to iron my work pants last week, out of laziness.  A week and a couple of wash cycles later, wrinkles prove to be more persistent, requiring intervention.  I don't judge others based on what they wear (unless they're homeless), but I'm almost certain I am the only employee at work that bothers to iron my pants.  Does that make me stiff and old-fashioned?  Perhaps it's just a quirk of my style.
