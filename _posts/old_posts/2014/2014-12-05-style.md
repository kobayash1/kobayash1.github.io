Ever since preparing for my friends' wedding last weekend, I've developed a fascination in style and fashion I never once possessed.  As a result of my weight training, I had no suitable attire for the occasion.  Over the ensuing weeks, I purchased new clothes in styles I had never paid any attention to in the past.  Such terms as "slim cut" and "fitted" were very much foreign to me.  But with newfound confidence bourne out of my weightlifting, I dug deeper down the style rabbit hole.

The Internet is a great thing.  My free time I would normally devote to reading linux related tech news slowly conceded to reading articles on men's fashion.  I found myself engrossed in pieces about how to determine quality of a dress shirt, how to build a diversified yet minimal wardrobe, how a suit should fit, and how to match colors and patterns.  If someone had told me six months ago before I started lifting that I would develop such an interest in clothing, I would have called them a liar.

Being in the physical shape I was in before, shopping for clothes was a boring and tedious experience I would keep as infrequent as I could.  But with my build transformed as it has, I actually enjoy it now.  I just have to be cautious as to not get carried away, as clothing can be quite expensive!
