I absolutely love the Internet.  One particular reason why is the amount of information one can acquire from simply browsing the right websites.  The past couple of days I've developed an interest in adopting cologne.

My grooming habits have remained largely unchanged since my days in high school.  I've used the same shampoo, body soap, and deodorant for over ten years now.  At twenty-seven years of age, I finally came to the realization that I need to stop using scented deodorants marketed to young adolescents.  I'm throwing away the Old Spice in favor of inoffensive unscented sticks.  Luckily, I've already been using unscented soap and shampoo.  What remains is to find some good scents to wear.  Simple enough, right?

But as with many things that seem simple and innocuous, there are layers of complexity involved in all aspects of cologne.  Lacking any knowledge of how to properly buy a cologne, I trawled the Internet for answers.  As one would expect when newly encountering such a sophisticated subject, answers I found to my initial questions only created more questions.

There are different groups of scents?  There is a difference between "Eau de Cologne," "Eau de Toilette," and "Perfume?"  Why do I need to have different fragrances for different seasons?  Cologne actually mixes with my natural pheromones?  Wait, what are pheromones?!  And what's this about aphrodisiacs?

Through my research spread over the course of the past two days, I am confident in stating that I am much more knowledgeable on cologne than most guys in my demographic.  However, I still have much to learn.  Tomorrow I will shop around various department stores to find a shop that offers free small samples for me to evaluate.  The process of buying cologne is one that requires a good amount of effort and patience.  The payoff, however, is finding a fragrance or fragrances that suit me and compliment my style.

The real issue is whom I can look to as a trustworthy third party for input on my considerations...
