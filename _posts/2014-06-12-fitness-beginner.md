I went to the Snap Fitness two minutes from my house today.  The staffer there was really friendly (and attractive) and got me signed up on a one month trial for $8.95.  I can sign up later on a monthly or yearly contract.  I'll probably spring for the yearly deal if I find Snap will fit my needs.

I asked my brother for advice on a good workout regimen yesterday.  Earlier today he referred me to a [workout plan](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/dwayne-johnson-rock-hard-hercules-workout-and-diet-plan.html "this is hardcore...") The Rock used in preparation for his role in the upcoming *Hercules* film.  I forgot to bring my phone with me to the gym, so I didn't get the chance to try some of those exercises.

My venture into Snap Fitness today was, in my recollection, the first time I ever stepped foot in a proper gym.  The gym was fairly small, located in a small strip mall.  There were a couple of patrons working out--not too crowded.  I didn't know what half of the equipment there was.  Not knowing what exercise to do, nor how to do them properly, I simply jogged on the treadmill for two ten minute sets.  I couldn't run anymore after that because my body wouldn't let me!

Resigned to my running fatigue, I approached the squat rack.  Unaware of how exactly to manipulate the equipment, I spent a good five minutes reading the instruction and warning stickers plastered to it.  The bar, 15 pounds in weight, is suspended on a sort of rail mechanism.  It moves freely up and down and stays even no matter where on the bar you lift it from.  There are a pair of hooks on the rails that latch onto rungs inside the rail mechanism that serve to stop the freely moving bar from dropping below them.  They serve as a safety to keep the weight from crushing the user.

After examining the squat rack to my satisfaction, I proceeded to do a set of 15 body weight squats.  I used this opportunity to observe myself in the nearby mirror to ensure I had proper form.  Note, I'm not sure if I indeed have proper squat form.  After that, I went ahead and performed a set of 10 squats using only the bar.

Finally, not knowing what exactly to do next, I ended my brief workout.  Later on I consulted my bodybuilding friend [@ChiTownYosh](http://twitter.com/chitownyosh "Beast Mode") for advice on direction.  He directed me to an article on [muscleandstrength.com](http://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/jason-blaha-ice-cream-fitness-5x5-novice-workout "not as beast mode") that he deemed would better suit my situation being a complete novice.

I now have a gym and a workout plan.  It's time to DOMINATE.
