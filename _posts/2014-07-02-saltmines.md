The final of five consecutive 8 hour shifts concluded with another highly productive yet very stressful day.  The day seemed to crawl along as the crew and I completed myriad tasks at a furious pace.  Many times throughout did I feel the time was much later than it was.  Heading home after the tiring and continuous shift (I enjoyed no break), it was time for the second workout of week 3.

I continue to make gains in my progress as I passed the straight bar curls 3x8 for the first time at 65 pounds.  I set more personal bests as well, failing only the bent over rows at 120 pounds.  Friday I will attempt to squat 75 pounds for five sets with five reps each.  Continuing to progress in a linear fashion, I can't wait to see further results.
