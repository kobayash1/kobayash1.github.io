I've been following Jason Blaha's Ice Cream Fitness workout regimen for the past twelve weeks.  The plan asks for three workouts per week.  Over this span of time, I've missed a total of three sessions.  I've progressed in a mostly linear fashion in regards to weight resistance.  Lately I've been stuck on some weights in many of my exercises, but the general trend is still upward.

As for the changes to my body, differences abound.  I can't even imagine my former fat self anymore.  What were initially subtle bumps and curves I noticed when showering are now much more prominent and resilient muscles.  Overall, the comparison of me twelve weeks ago with my body as of this morning is quite dramatic.

However, regardless of my progress, I am definitely not finished.  In fact, I don't think I ever will be "finished."  One thing is for sure.  As I continue with my training, I will only get stronger.  I'll be able to lift heavier and heavier, and I can't wait to see what my physique will look like after another 12 weeks!
