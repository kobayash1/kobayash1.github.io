A busy schedule on Wednesday prevented me from doing my scheduled workout.  Today's makeup workout was killer!  I pushed myself hard and was able to succeed at all my lifts save for the close grip bench press and arm curls.  The core lifts for today (squat, deadlift, and overhead press) I was able to complete with weights close to my personal records.  I can't wait for Monday to start the next week of training!

## Self-Improvement

Aside from personal fitness, I've begun to pursue improving the mental, emotional, and spiritual aspects of my life.  I figure if I have come this far with improving the physical aspect of my life, why not do the same for the others?  I visited the local Barnes and Noble a few days ago, perusing the aisles for literature on self-improvement.  Most of these such books were for various diets and exercise routines.  However, I did find a selection of pieces directed towards non-physical self-improvement.  I picked up a couple of these books and have started reading one of them.  About a third of the way through the first book, the central message of this work seems to be that one must do what he can to be his best self.  I'll likely write a book review once I finish reading.
