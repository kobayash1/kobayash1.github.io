I'm struggling to write a new post.  There's so many thoughts flying through my head that I cannot organize them cohesively.  I can write pages detailing everything about this stress I'm feeling, but there's so much to express that I can't form the right paragraphs.  I have a million things to say, but I am at a loss for words.  The only thing clear is that I have caused grief for someone I care deeply about.  And I feel completely horrible about it.
