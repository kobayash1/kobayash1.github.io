My visit to Planet Fitness a few days ago, while less than ideal, gave me a taste of the convenience of a 24-hour gym.  The gym I currently go to, Fitness 19, is not open 24 hours.  The price is really low, and they furnish the equipment I need for my workouts (a proper squat rack).  However, work as of late has been asking me to do more night shifts.  Combined with various errands to run at home with my daytime availability and the occasional call from work for a couple of hours on special catering orders, time for workouts has been hard to find.  I've already skipped several workouts the past couple of weeks due to not having time during the day to visit the gym.

While I would never consider a membership at Planet Fitness, there is another popular franchise gym in the Chicagoland area that is open 24 hours a day and actually does feature proper lifting equipment along with other extra amenities.  Xsport Fitness has a lot of locations in Chicago and its suburbs.  Unfortunately, none of them are in my hometown of Elgin.  There are two within reasonable driving distance.  Locations in St. Charles and Schaumburg would be the closest to me.  Today, I will visit those gyms to inquire about membership fees and visit the facilities in person.  Perhaps I'll take pictures.
