The last time I updated my spreadsheet was week 27 back in late December.  I went to the gym on and off, not sticking to my usual 3 sessions per week regimen.  I even took two rest weeks during that time period.  Week 34 began earlier this week, and with a renewed motivation in my weight training, I didn't skip the workouts on Monday and Wednesday.  I also finally updated my spreadsheet.

Surprisingly, despite my lack of consistency the past few weeks, I managed to meet personal records on some of my lifts.  Tomorrow will be the last session for this week, and if I push hard enough I may be able to set new records for myself!  Here are my workouts from earlier in the week:

The bench press at 135 pounds is my personal record which I hope to break on Monday.  If I can succeed at the barbell curls at 70 pounds tomorrow, that too will be a new personal best.  Yea buddeh!
