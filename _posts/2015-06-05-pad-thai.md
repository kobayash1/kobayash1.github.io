Today, I had the pleasure of eating dinner at Thai Square restaurant in Des Plaines.  The place was highly rated both on Google and on Yelp.  I was also pretty hungry.  I ordered some tofu pad thai and my meal arrived in short order.

I've tried pad thai in many different Thai and non-Thai restaurants.  I can say with ease that the pad thai I tasted today at Thai Square is easily among the best, if not the best.  Next time I find myself in Des Plaines, I will definitely have to come back!
