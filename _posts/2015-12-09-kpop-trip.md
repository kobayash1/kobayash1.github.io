I've been on a Korean pop music (k-pop) trip since the summer.  I've mostly been focusing on listening to as much stuff that's been released in 2015 only.  I'll catch up on the good stuff from years prior starting next year.  I've always known about k-pop, but never seriously started listening to it until recently.  There's a lot of good stuff here!  I created a playlist on YouTube of some of my top k-pop tracks which is now over 100 videos.  I'll embed a couple of them here.
