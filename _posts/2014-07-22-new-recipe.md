A short shift at work was followed by a patient visit in Plainfield.  The entire trip from home to the patient's residence and back was long yet pleasant.  We stopped by one of our favorite restaurants in Bloomingdale for dinner.

Hong Ning, a restaurant specializing in Filipino cuisine, also offers a few traditional Chinese dishes.  Though not on their menu, it was here I was inspired by the idea to learn a recipe for honey walnut shrimp.  A personal favorite of mine, I am hoping I can execute the dish well enough to serve to my colleague and appease her palate.
