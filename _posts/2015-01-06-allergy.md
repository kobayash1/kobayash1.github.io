Over the past couple months, I've been scheduled mostly drive thru shifts at work.  This past week, however, I was scheduled a few consecutive carver roles.  After having not performed the crew function in a long while, it took me a shift or two to regain my rhythm and performance.  One thing I do a lot more when working carver is wash my hands.

Now, I wash my hands at work a lot.  However, my 8 hour shift requires I do so even more.  Serving the carver role for 4 straight days is starting to show on my hands.  I am either allergic to the gloves or the soap.

On a more serious note, one of my colleagues whom I really enjoy working with has fallen ill.  I can only keep her in my thoughts and prayers, wishing for the best.
