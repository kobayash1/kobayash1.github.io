I missed the third and final workout last week due to working double shifts.  As a result, my lifts for today's workout suffered.  I needed to reduce weights on the squats to complete even one set.  The other exercises stagnated at the weights I used for this past Wednesday.  Reminded today of the importance of keeping my regimen schedule, I'm now resolved to no longer work double shifts on my workout days.  Hopefully I can get back on track by Wednesday's workout.
