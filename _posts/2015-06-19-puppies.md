I visited my aunt at her home today.  She was having a party to remember my uncle whom had recently passed away.  Filipino tradition dictates that one must hold not only a funeral for the deceased, but also a celebratory remembrance forty days after the passing and again one year later.  Today was the forty days remembrance.  The party itself wasn't particularly large, but still present were enough relatives that I could'nt name even half of the people there.  I arrived late, so I missed prayer.  The food was delicious, albeit already cold.

Still, good times were had catching up with some cousins I hadn't seen in a while.  My aunt has two puppies.  One is a corgi, and the other a Shiba-Inu.  They are both very friendly and adorable.  Yes, I am using this post as an excuse to share some cute dog pictures.
