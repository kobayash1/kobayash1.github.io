So I come in to work yesterday and I'm informed of the latest update of my colleague who has been battling cancer.  She hasn't been responding to chemotherapy.  Her prognosis is poor.

I'm left thinking to myself.  When was the last time I saw her?  What was the last thing I said to her?  Will that indeed be the last interaction I had with her?  Should I even be dwelling on thoughts like these?  I don't know.  It's been a while since the last time someone of influence to me passed.  One of my closest aunts also lost a battle with cancer 3 years ago.

The day after I write about how people's lives can converge and diverge I'm served another reminder of the ephemeral nature of our time here.  Life really is fleeting.  Live it to the fullest and cherish those you have in your life.
