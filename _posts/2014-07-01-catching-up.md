My brother battling other heros in *Dota 2* the past couple nights attributed to my lack of entries recently.  Numerous thoughts sprouted in my mind over the course of these days that span the usual topics of work and fitness.  A couple outlier processes keep my mind from getting too stale.

I prepared the beef broccoli I first cooked earlier last week for my colleague to sample on Sunday morning.  Seemingly enjoying the dish, I wondered what else I could learn to prepare for her palette.  Though an idea hasn't yet materialized, I'm sure I will find inspiration somewhere.  My motivations in cooking for my colleague?  Perhaps I'll explore that in a future blog post, though there really is not much to say.  

The following Monday brought a very hectic work shift that involved multiple power outages creating delays and chaos in my usual workflow.  Somehow, I managed to work through the shift but not without creating further problems for others through some crucial mistakes.  Upon arrival at home, I was asked to retrieve food my mom had ordered from our favorite Chinese restaurant in Schaumburg.  Because I was already planning on cooking dinner for myself, I didn't partake in the carry-out.  The errand and subsequent dinner preparations pushed my workout past 8 o'clock.  Thankfully I had the foresight to subscribe at a gym open 24 hours.

I almost thoroughly dominated my workout.  Failing the tricep extensions at 70 pounds, I exerted myself to success in the other exercises.  The squats, which I had failed on Wednesday at 60 pounds, were surprisingly less difficult at the higher 65 pound resistance.  I cannot wait for tomorrow to try 70 pounds.

Today passed in a typical 8-hour shift fashion.  I am starting to see less help from the managers with my duties at work.  I can only assume I am instilling more confidence in them that I can perform all my responsibilities unaided.  Though this signals more work for me and requires optimizations in my workflow, it is a challenge I am willing to accept.  Improvement can only be a good thing.

## Food

Researching more recipes online, I find myself needing a proper wok.  Reading articles suggesting how to purchase a quality wok, I learned there are a different subset of rules regarding their use and maintenance.  Perhaps the most surprising note I found was that cleaning a wok with soap and water is typically not encouraged.  I'll continue my wok research in order to make the most informed decision I can when finally buying one soon.
