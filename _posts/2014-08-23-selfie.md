A few weeks ago I bought a new polo at the mall.  My usual size of choice in shirts is either large or extra large.  That day I bought a medium sized polo.  This was the first time I had ever purchased anything "medium" sized.  Though the polo at the time was a little snug around the waist, I used that as motivation to continue my weight training.

"Soon, I'll be able to rock this shit proper."

Tonight, I was headed to a friend's house for some TECHNIKA action.  He recently bought an entire cabinet for his own personal use.  A few weeks ago, he threw a party to reunite the old Gameworks Technika crew.  Having not played TECHNIKA since then I asked him earlier this week if it was kosher I came tonight for a session.  With this opportunity for a carefree night out, I figured I'd try the new polo on.

Having never really taken very many selfies, I never fully understood the reasons why so many people appear addicted to taking such pictures.  However, I guess when you have something to show off, sharing selfies is one powerfully gratifying way to do just that.  I suppose this adds one more source of motivation towards achieving personal fitness.
