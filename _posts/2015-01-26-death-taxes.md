[Turbo Tax](https://turbotax.intuit.com/personal-taxes/) is offering to file simple federal and state taxes free.  After confirming the availability of my W-2 online, I proceeded to their website to file my taxes.  This was the first time I filed personally.  Before, I'd send my W-2 to my aunt and she would file them for me.

The interface on the Turbo Tax website is very clean and elegant.  To file a simple tax return, they ask you a few questions to find out what tax exemptions you may qualify for.  The process was very easy and straightforward.  Overall, it took me less than one hour.  Cool!

Our family recently said goodbye to a trusted and reliable friend of the past ten years.  Over 250 thousand hard-earned miles later, the Aviator finally bit the dust when the transmission failed.  We'll miss you!  Sorta.
