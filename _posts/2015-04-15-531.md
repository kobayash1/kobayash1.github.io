A surprise double shift on Monday prevented my workout.  So yesterday was my first day on Wendler 5/3/1.  The workout went as follows:

Squat
- 5x65
- 5x80
- 3x95
- 5x100
- 5x115
- 5x+135

I was able to complete all the sets, but I was too fatigued to attempt more than five reps on the last set.

With only a short period of stretching, the entire workout elapsed in well under an hour.  I do, however, need to add in some assistance work.  I must conduct more research to find the right exercises for me to compliment the main lifts.  Wendler's program incorporates 4 main lifts:  squat, bench press, deadlift, and overhead press.  Some possible accessory lifts for me to consider would definitely be more "pulling" exercises.  Pull ups, chin ups, rows, and face pulls are some of the ones I'm thinking about adding.  I'll figure some of it out for Thursday.
