Between work and a number of errands to be performed after work, there was no time remaining on Monday for my scheduled workout.  So week 10 started on Tuesday.  For this week, I'll shift my workouts from M/W/F to T/Th/Sat before returning to the usual routine next week.  Yesterday I was able to complete the 140 pound squat exercise that eluded me on Friday.  As gratifying as that was, I can't wait for Thursday to try 145!

## Work

I haven't blogged lately about my colleague who also happens to be my love interest.  There hasn't been any news worth writing about.  I still feel the same way about her as I did a month ago, despite the feeling not being mutual.  Regardless of what she may think of me, I don't think anything or anyone can ever change my opinion.
