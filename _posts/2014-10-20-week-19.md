A half day on duty presented me with a rare opportunity to do stuff outside of work.  I began the morning cooking lunch for my colleagues before darting out the door.  After a busy four hours that went smoothly only because of the skilled staff scheduled for today, I headed to the gym for the beginning of week 19.  I struggled mightily with the squats again, but excelled in all the other exercises.  Hopefully the squats will catch up soon.

Following the productive workout was the task of cleaning the mess I had left in the kitchen.  A trip to the hardware store to replace the dirty furnace air filter finished up the rest of my afternoon.  I prepared the remaining flank steak from this morning to cook one more portion of beef broccoli for tonight's dinner.  While the beef marinated, I took the time to iron my work pants.  The beef broccoli turned out delicious.  The previous time I cooked the dish was using a cheaper cut of flank steak from a different grocer than usual.  The old adage "you get what you pay for" appears true.

I think I will retire early tonight and attempt to get at least 11 hours of sleep.
