Yesterday was another 8 hour shift at work that proved to be particularly punishing.  Skipping breakfast as I often do, I didn't have a chance to eat a single bite until I arrived home half past seven.  The shift at work involved more physical labor than typically required.  Towards the end of my shift a slight pain in my upper back began to nag at me.

It was no time to recover, however, as week 7 of my training followed immediately after work.  The increasing weights are starting to catch up with my ability, as I failed to complete four of my eight exercises.  Moreover, my form on the squat is progressively deteriorating as the weight increases.  I believe I am bringing my hips up without bringing the bar up at the same rate.  This ends up with me in a "good-morning" position halfway through the squat.

"Good-morning" is an exercise that works the lower back muscles and is often an exercise unintentionally performed when practicing improper squat form.  The result is I am no longer engaging my quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes as much as I am supposed to, because my back is doing most of the lifting instead of my legs.  My only solution to this problem is to refrain from increasing the weight with each workout until I can squat the current weight of 125 pounds without losing proper form.  If I prove unable to perform the squats correctly at 125, a weight decrease by ten percent will be in order.

Upon arriving home, I was too overcome with fatigue to eat more than a few bites of food before retiring to bed, despite eating nothing since the night before.

## Today

By comparison, today was largely uneventful.  After catching up with food in the morning, the rest of the day was spent updating the PC, clearing a backlog of news from my RSS feed, and walking through the mall after dropping my mom off at a salon.  While at the mall, I picked up samples of Lacoste White and Calvin Klein Dark Obsession.  I think I'll try White tomorrow.
