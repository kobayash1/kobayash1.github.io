Given my propensity to forget things, I knew it was bound to happen some time.  I forgot my sunglasses at work.  The problem is that left them all the way in Lombard.  Sigh.

I haven't yet taken a picture of them, either.  This coming week may be a good opportunity, as it marks my one year anniversary since I started lifting.  Perhaps a before and after comparison would be fit.  I wonder if any of my friends has a DSLR handy...
