The domain chrisbayot.com currently points to a WordPress installation I have on a <a href="http://digitalocean.com">Digital Ocean</a> cloud server.  It was nice for a few days.  But a friend I follow on Twitter (<a href="http//twitter.com/dakanya">@dakanya</a>) immediately suggested I use a static site generator to do simple blogging.

A few days and a lot of internet reading later, I have the new blog.chrisbayot.com!  Since this site is hosted on GitHub Pages for free, I no longer have any use for the WordPress blog hosted on a server that I have to pay for.  Soon, blog.chrisbayot.com will become the new chrisbayot.com.  So excited!
