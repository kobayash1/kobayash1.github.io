I have two pairs of black wash Pronto Uomo jeans from their "Blue" line.  I bought the first pair in 36x30 several years ago.  I was so satisfied with the comfortable fit, I bought a second pair a month later.  Fast forward to today and I have grown tired of folding my jeans over to tighten up the belt and keep them on.  With the company Christmas party last night quickly approaching, I used the event as an excuse for myself to finally purchase a new pair.

Friday I visited the mall in search of a pair of quality dark wash denim that would flatter my body type.  Now, I'm not yet quite the huge bodybuilder with thighs like watermelons and glutes like holiday hams, but searching for denim jeans without compromising fit for comfort or vice versa proved an arduous task for even a novice weightlifter as myself.  My search began at Nordstrom where I could browse different independent clothing brands not made by the same megafactory in Canada (that's a subject for another article).  And while the quality of jeans I found there were very high and indeed I found some fits that worked with my legs, the price points were beyond my budget.  I proceeded to the Levi's store.

Here I would spend nearly an hour and a half before finishing my trip.  Between the different styles, washes, and sizes of the jeans offered by Levi's it felt like I tried on a hundred different pairs of jeans.  Despite the sheer selection of denim, the best pair of jeans I could settle on required some compromise.  A pair of 504 regular straights provided the leg room in the thighs without being too skin-hugging and also allowed enough room in the seat and crotch so I could walk comfortably without *pinching myself*.  The problem of course was that the size that allowed these freedoms was a 33x30 with plenty of slack in the waist.  Granted, the extra length in the waist was a significant improvement compared to my existing old jeans.  It was still a compromise.

Resigned to my fate of having to bunch up the material at the top with a belt, I walked to the cashier ready to purchase.  Before I paid, however, I explained my problem to the associate helping me.  John, as he introduced himself, guided me to a corner of the store where they were featuring a new fit that Levi's had introduced just a couple of months ago.  Prominently displayed behind the storefront glass, the new Levi's 541 table was segregated from the rest of the men's denim jeans.  I naturally strolled past it on my way in.  Billed as a product for "guys who want a tailored look with the comfort of a relaxed jean," the 541's are "roomier in the seat and thigh, with a slightly tapered leg opening."

I fitted the 31x30.  It was damn near perfect.  The 31 inch (or so it claims) sat at my waist with little to no slack.  My thighs filled out nicely but with enough room to not make the pants appear skin tight.  I could walk and move around without experiencing discomfort.  The taper from knee to ankle provided shape to my calves without restricting bloodflow to my feet.  Thrilled and ecstatic, I promptly returned the 504's to the shelf and presented the 541's to the cashier with giddy excitement.  If the jeans wear well and survive washing without horrible shrinking, I will definitely look into purchasing another pair in the future if my weightlifing gains continue to further transform my body.

My weight has been lingering around 165 to 170 pounds for the past few months now.  Fat loss has slowed down, while muscle building continues.  However, one of my former managers came to the party last night and asked me if I had lost more weight since she had left our restaurant.  After explaining to her my steady weight of late, she attributed her surprise to seeing me in casual clothing instead of my usual (loose fitting) work uniform.  Another female colleague of mine complimented my outfit, calling attention to my coordinated red dress shirt with red Chuck Taylors.

It's amazing how well fitted clothing can draw better attention to you and, as a result, boost one's confidence!
