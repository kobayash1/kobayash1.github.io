With my brother's car in the shop requiring a replacement rear sway bar, I abbreviated today's workout skipping the shrugs, crunches, and tricep extensions to pick him up from work.  I came very close to completing squats at 145 pounds, failing on the very last rep.  I likely would have succeeded if not for some gym member asking if he could use the squat rack, hurrying my rest period.  Oh well.

I think after week 24 I'll post another picture comparison.  My muscles are definitely growing especially on my arms, but the rate of fat loss has noticeably declined.  I don't think any changes to my diet or regimen are necessary to achieve the look I want.  I'm in no hurry to reach my fitness goals, but given the choice I'd rather have sooner than later.
