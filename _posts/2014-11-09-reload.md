I haven't done much but do a fresh install of Arch Linux on it, but transferring configs and various other personalizations was very easy since the old HDD is still plugged in.  Simply mounting the hard disk to /mnt gave me quick access to all my custom scripts and settings.  I'll have to test games and put in a few more hours with it before I can really grasp the performance improvements.  However, I am already excited to have just reached my familiar desktop with little difficulty!
