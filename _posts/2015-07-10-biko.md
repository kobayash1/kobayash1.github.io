"Biko" is a traditional Filipino dessert served at family reunions and other such special occasions.  I had a sweet tooth today and decided I would try and make it for the first time.  I looked up a recipe on the Internet and found a simple one on [Panlasang Pinoy](http://panlasangpinoy.com/2009/10/31/filipino-asian-food-dessert-rice-cake-biko-recipe/).  The ingredient list is minimal.

- glutinous rice
- coconut milk
- brown sugar
- salt
- water

I followed the portions listed on Panlasang and the biko turned out great, albeit with room for improvement.  Next time I prepare biko, I'll wait longer before adding the rice to the coconut milk mixture (I added it a bit too soon) and I'll prepare the toasted coconut shavings for garnish.  Still, not bad for a first try.
