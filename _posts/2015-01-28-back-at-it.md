I took a break from lifting last week.  I had recently lost some of my motivation for going to the gym regularly (the reasons why being content enough for a blog post of its own).  Thankfully, simply recalling my appearance this time last year is enough to restore my conviction!  After skipping Monday's workout as well, I finally returned to the gym today after work.  My sets went as follows:

- Squats 3x5 135 lbs.
      - 5, 5, 5
- Bench press 5x5 135 lbs.
      - 4, 4, 4, 3, 3
- Bent over rows 5x5 135 lbs.
      - 5, 5, 5, 5, 5
- Barbell shrugs 3x8 185 lbs.
      - 8, 8, 8
- Barbell curls 3x8 65 lbs.
      - 8, 8, 8
- Tricep extensions 3x8 55 lbs.
      - 8, 8, 8
- Cable crunches 3x10 77.5 lbs.
      - 10, 10, 10
- Glute bridges 3x10 100 lbs.
      - 10, 10, 10

Not bad after taking over a week off!  Hopefully by Monday I'll be back to full form and able to bench 135!
