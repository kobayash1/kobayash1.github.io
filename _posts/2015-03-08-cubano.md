Remember the pork shoulder from Tuesday's blog entry?  I used that in a Cuban-style pressed sandwich.  The sandwich itself is ham, swiss cheese, mustard, pickles, and pork shoulder on a soft baguette and pressed on a skillet.  It tasted as good as it looks.

The pork shoulder is marinated overnight in a mixture of orange juice, lemon juice, garlic, and onion.  The next morning it is dry rubbed with salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and cumin before being slow roasted in the oven at 275 degrees.

I wonder what I should try cooking next.
