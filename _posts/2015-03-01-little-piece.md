You're gonna get a lot of phone calls, text messages, and posts on your Facebook wall today.  The texts will eventually get deleted and the likes on Facebook will fade to the obscurity of the bottom of the page.  This webpage, however, will be here for as long as I live!  Maybe even longer than that.

Anyway, recorded here for posterity is me wishing you a happy birthday, Janet!
