Mondays after work, around 5 to 6 PM, tend to be the most crowded at my gym.  Today, I was scheduled to do some squats and bench presses.  However, the two flat benches were constantly occupied during my time there.  I didn't feel like waiting in line, so I simply did other exercises.  I completed the squats and added face pulls, pull ups, and curls to finish up.  I managed to do 3 pull ups three times.  A new record for me!  I'll likely do bench press on Wednesday with deadlift and overhead press on Friday.
