Week 35 started on Monday with a good workout.  It continued today with another highly productive session.  The glute bridges continue to progress linearly, but it's starting to finally get difficult at 145 pounds.  I'll try 155 on Friday.  I came so close to finally succeeding at 150 pound squats.  I missed the exercise by just one rep!  Hopefully I can finally conquer it next workout!
