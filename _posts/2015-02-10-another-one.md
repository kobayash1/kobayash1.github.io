In my days of playing fighting games competitively, I used Twitter extensively ([follow me on Twitter, by the way!](http://twitter.com/kobayash1)).  Ever since my pseudo-retirement, however, my presence on Twitter has drastically fallen.  I maybe check Twitter once or twice a week nowadays.

Twitter was and continues to be the best way for me to keep in contact with the many friends I've made from playing fighting games in the local Chicagoland community.  The last game I played seriously was Persona 4 Arena in 2013.  Since then, many other games have been released, including a sequel to P4A which I still haven't purchased.

I logged into Twitter today to see what's up as of late.  It turns out that one of my friends, an avid anime fighting game player from Chicago, was recently diagnosed with cancer.  I haven't been to the weekly gatherings in almost two years now.  I'll definitely make an effort to go to a gathering and catch up with him and the others very soon.
