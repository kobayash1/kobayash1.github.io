Inclement weather prevented me from doing two of my workouts last week.  I headed to the gym today uncertain of how my missed time would affect my lifts.  Much to my surprise, I actually completed most of my exercises at the weights I left off at!

I completed squat 3x5 at 145 pounds, failed the last rep of bench 5x5 at 135 pounds, and completed all the other exercises to at least the last rep, with the exclusion of the tricep extensions I failed early in the final set.  About two weeks ago, I added glute bridges to my routine.  I do 3x10 for both A and B workouts.  I started at 50 pounds, but today I completed it at 80 pounds.

Glute bridges are definitely not an exercise you want to do at the gym if you are self-conscious!  However, now that I finally own a pair of well fitting jeans, I have to do whatever needs to be done in order to fill them out!
