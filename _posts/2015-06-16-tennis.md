I played tennis last Tuesday with a friend of mine.  It had been the first time I played tennis in about two years.  I had forgotten how much fun it is!

We played again today and followed it up with some decent Asian cuisine at a nearby restaurant.  Last week, we played in Streamwood, near my place.  This time I had to drive out to Dekalb near his home.  That shit's far!
