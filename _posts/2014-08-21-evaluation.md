Today involved a rare night shift at work after visiting patients.  The shift itself was also unusual as I received my employee review.  I had never received such an evaluation under the previous manager, so today was a new experience.

Without going into too much detail, my evaluation score was disappointingly underwhelming.  I'm not the model employee at work, but neither do I consider myself insufficient.  The scores I received on all the judged criteria, however, would suggest exactly that.  Frustrated, I put my head down and went straight back to work.

My night shift involved working with the regular night crew.  Almost all of whom I respect as dilligent colleagues.  Excluding tonight's cashier.  A typically busy dinner service proved hectic and difficult for everyone involved.  However, when a former employee arrived as a customer, I quietly increased my workload (and stress) as I assumed the neglected duties of my then distracted co-worker.

Under normal circumstances, I would welcome the opportunity to prove my worth.  Here I was working extra hard without a complaint as my colleague began to slack off, idly chatting with a dining room full of tasks to perform.  The superiors would notice my work ethic and opinions of my initiative would be highly favorable.  Such instances like these arise very commonly.  I pride myself on staying constantly occupied while on the clock as others are viewing their phones.

But as I learned today, qualities I may consider vital to meeting and exceeding expectations at my workplace don't necessarily correlate to those my company holds in high regard.

After my chat with the manager regarding my evaluation, I got up from my chair to return to work.  On the table was the review of the next employee.  It was that of tonight's cashier.  He scored better than me by 6 points.
