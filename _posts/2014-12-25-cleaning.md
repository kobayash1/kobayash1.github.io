With my family having celebrated on Christmas Eve, I had nothing to do for Christmas day.  I used this opportunity to finally clean and organize my closet.

About a couple of weeks ago, I removed most of my old clothes that have become too large for me.  Some of them I gave to friends, the rest I donated to Goodwill.  Removing all the articles in the closet revealed all the dust and cobwebs that have accumulated over a period of years.  I spent some time thoroughly cleaning the space and reorganizing the remaining hangers.  Now, I just need to replace my old jeans with better fitting ones and my newfound minimal wardrobe will be complete!
