Last night, I started to develop a runny nose.  Dismissing it as an onset of allergies, I paid it little attention.  This morning however, my condition worsened.  Coughing, sneezing, sinus congestion, runny nose, and some body aches made getting out of bed a trial.  Undeterred, I went to work to perform my 6 hour shift.

Apparently, the bug is going around.  A number of my colleagues have been experiencing the same symptoms since last week.  Shortly into my shift, my colleague offered me some medicine to help alleviate my symptoms.  The pills were a combination pill of acetaminophen 325 mg, guaifenesin 20 mg, and phenylephrine 5 mg.  She had forgotten the trade name of the medication.  After work, I took the time to Google it and found it was Mucinex.

A combination of psudoephedrine and loratidine is what normally does the trick for me with these symptoms.  Out of Clartitin-D, however, I soldiered on with work.  Mucinex doesn't quite have the effect Claritin-D does with me, but it still gave me tangible results.  The sneezing persisted, but the coughing, runny nose, and body aches were improved.  Very grateful for her kindness, I should find a way to repay her.

## Fitness

Tomorrow will be the start of week 12.  However, I am unsure if I should go ahead with my workout if my cold symptoms persist.  I may skip tomorrow's workout.

## Addendum

Feeling a little warm, I took my temperature.  I should drink fluids and get plenty of rest.
