Checking in early last night, I got almost 12 hours of sleep when I finally awoke at 7 in the morning.  Thankfully I received all the rest I did, since I needed plenty of energy to get me through a very busy 8 hour shift today.

A couple days ago, I completely reset my phone, and updated the Android version in the process.  I had planned on re-installing all my necessary apps and configuring the new settings after work.  However, I find myself too tired to expend the energy required.  Instead, I searched local gyms to find one with a power rack while I updated my computer with a

      sudo pacman -Syu && yaourt -Syua
     {% endraw %}

Even though I recently updated my system, I was startled to find a large number of packages that needed updating.  The process consumed a considerable amount of time, during which I found a local gym with a proper power rack.

Fitness 19 in South Elgin is not open 24 hours like Snap is close to my home.  However, I called them up and learned that they have one power rack.  That is one power rack more than Snap Fitness.  I will tour their facilities tomorrow after work.  First, a long night of sleep is in good order.
