Week 39 began yesterday after work.  Despite skipping the rows and tricep extensions, the workout was still quite exhausting.  I set new personal records on the barbell shrug (210 lbs.), the glute bridge (225 lbs.), and *finally* succeeded at the 70 pound straight bar curls!  Thankfully, I'm not totally sore today.  Hopefully the gains continue for Wednesday's workout!
