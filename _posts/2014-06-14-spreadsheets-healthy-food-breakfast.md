A few years ago, I was an avid DJMAX Technika player.  The rhythm based arcade game features a touchscreen you poke at to the rhythm of the music playing.  It featured online scoreboards and stat tracking.  There was also an active and vibrant community behind it.  The one Technika machine in my area created its own local scene.  Completely enthralled by the game and appreciative of the new friends I made through it, I started tracking my playing stats and those of my friends that weren't already being recorded by the game.  As intriguing as it was that DJMAX had online servers to keep individual player statistics, the tangibles measured weren't all-encompassing.  I created spreadsheets on Google Drive (Docs, at the time) that tracked further information based on what was readily available via the game's website.  Everyone agreed I exhibited symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder but, over time, many appreciated the work I was committing to.

Some time later, the company behind the game re-focused its attention, and the online aspect, the fun aspect, of the game was gone.  Player interest faded quickly, and I stopped maintaining the spreadsheets due to lack of new data.  Since then, I haven't even touched Google Drive.  Fast forward to today.

I will begin my training Monday.  To prepare and ensure that I keep accurate records of the weights I use, I've come back to the spreadsheet.  Since Blaha's 5x5 workout routine involves recalculating the weights you use based on success or failure to complete an exercise, a spreadsheet that records all the details and is saved online is ideal.  I can edit it from my phone, I'll never forget which exercises I failed nor the weights I used, and I can use it for archival purposes.  Perhaps a year later, I can look back at previous exercise results and gain a greater perspective of my progress.  I can show it off to others, too.

Aside from spreadsheets, I purchased various groceries today to stock up on the week.  Eggs, yogurt, chicken, salmon, and other healthy foods were on the bill.  I'm not completely certain regarding the exact diet I will adhere to, but one thing is for sure.  No more fast food.  No more soda.

## Side note

After generously completing many of my regular duties at work today, my colleague remarked that I owed her breakfast tomorrow.  Later, she clarified that she was only joking.  Well what the heck did I buy all these groceries for?  No matter.  Hopefully she doesn't hate mushrooms...
