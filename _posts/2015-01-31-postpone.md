A fierce case of delayed onset muscle soreness from yesterday continued today, albeit with less intensity.  The aches were still enough to prevent me from going to the gym today, though.  I'll push Friday's workout to Saturday and return to my regular 3 workouts per week routine on Monday.  Hopefully the DOMS from Saturday's workout won't last more than a day.  Workout B is on the agenda for tomorrow.  I'll likely stick to the following routine:

- Squat 3x5 135 lbs.
- Overhead press 5x5 80 lbs.
- Deadlift 1x5 185 lbs.
- Close grip bench press 3x8 115 lbs.
- Barbell curl 3x8 65 lbs
- Cable crunch 3x1077.5 lbs.
- Glute bridge 3x10 110 lbs.

## Fashion

I bought a couple of work polos the other day at the outlet mall.  The prices were right (about $20) so I took the opportunity to update that part of my wardrobe.  The large polos I bought for work over a year ago served me well, but it's time to drop them in the donations box!
