I finished reading my first book on self-improvement today.  I learned many lessons from it and have already started incorporating them into my life.  Many of those truths served as a cold hard slap of reality to my face.  Over the course of the next several blog entries, I'll quote excerpts from the book that directly apply to me and my past experiences.  I'll start with one such excerpt today.

The first lesson of self-improvement pertains to confidence.  The author outlines various attitudes and mindsets a man must reject so that he does not exhibit un-masculine behaviors.  One such idea is the notion of being *inadequate*

> Even if a male only wants a woman because he likes her as a person, chances are he believes that is not a good enough reason for him to get her. He believes he has nothing to offer her, as if he himself is not good enough, even though the woman alone is good enough for him and he would be more than happy to end up with her. Not only does he not care if she is wearing expensive clothes with the trendiest brands, but he would also be more than happy to have her even without any clothes at all.

> Such beliefs are unfortunately normal because most males are raised to accept them. Hence, they feel (or act) inadequate, not good enough for and unworthy of women. Since the idea of the need to earn women is deeply engrained in our society, it is normal to accept it without questioning it. Rather than challenging why they are not good enough alone, or if they really have to be, males accept it and seek out ways to become more valuable in the eyes of females. They try to become funnier, “wine and dine” a woman, study for years to get a degree, buy a car or a house, work extra hours to afford a suit or watch of a classier brand, or learn magic tricks to be entertaining etc.

> Since most males also believe they have to feel certain on the inside to be confident with women and because most of them believe that women want plenty of things that they do not have, they are likely to lack confidence around women and feel inadequate to get them. Meanwhile, they will prioritize success in society to feel certain that a female would be interested in them, and they will postpone the pursuit of women until they feel worthy, expecting that there will be such a day.

> Nevertheless, the real issue is actually not that males feel inadequate for women; it is actually that they believe there is something that is good enough. Believing they have to earn women in the first place is the real issue, because you don’t.

> If this sounds like you, you have to change the way you think, as these underlying beliefs (this mindset) will be noticeable in your behavior (your manners). Drop the notion of having to earn women. It is fine to earn material things, but women are not objects, so it would be wrong to treat them as such.

> The next time you catch yourself thinking that you do not deserve a woman; remind yourself that you are absolutely right, but you are right because you do not have to deserve them. You still have to seduce them, but that requires time spent directly with them, not long hours at the office or trying to save the planet to prove yourself. Women are lovely, but they are still human beings, not divine goddesses that require offerings, sacrifices, entertainment, or gifts from you, so you have to treat them in a realistic fashion.

> However, males who feel inadequate do several other things around women in an attempt to compensate for their inadequacy. You have to be aware of this and similar behaviors, even if you think highly of yourself and do not believe you have to earn women, so that you do not turn women off. These behaviors are common among adult males and taught to all children, in particular as part of the process of creating “good boys.” However, the so-called good manners that most mothers raise their sons to adopt insofar as how to treat females have more to do with how a mother wants her son to treat her, as she is the primary female in her boy’s life. She does not want her son to have a sexual relationship with her, but instead wants him to respect her above all else, to seek her approval, to be polite, to apologize, to explain his behavior, adapt to her commands, follow her lead, and do as he is told. This submissive behavior is the behavior a mother wants her son to exhibit when he interacts with her, but it is the opposite of the behavior that is sexually attractive to women who are naturally attracted to men, not boys. Thus, when boys grow up and apply these “good manners” with the women they want to have a sexual relationship with, those women are repulsed. Since they still enjoy being spoiled, however, they do not mind keeping the grown “boys” around, although “just as friends.”

Damn, I *fucked up*!
