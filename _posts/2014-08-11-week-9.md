A phone call from work asking me to fill in for a missing colleague's shift for the second consecutive day started off my Monday.  Naturally, I welcomed the 2 hour upgrade and gladly showed up to work earlier than scheduled.  Generating an unusually high amount of foot traffic throughout the shift, today seemed to fly by as we worked tirelessly to serve the horde of customers.

Deciding to repeat last Wednesday's workout after missing my exercises for Friday, I still had some difficulty in completing all my exercises.  On Wednesday, I will attempt the newly increased weights originally intended for this past Friday.  Hopefully the integrity of my form will hold up throughout my routine as I attempt new personal records.  Changes in my body are starting to become even more prominent now than they were six weeks into my training.  I remain very excited to see my progression after week 12 and onward.
