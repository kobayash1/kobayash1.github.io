Friday, I had no opportunity to visit my gym for my typical workout due to work and more work afterwards.  By some unusual circumstances, the same scenario played out today as well.  Necessary trips to visit patients after my scheduled work hours have left me with a decision to make regarding my training regimen.  Should I do my workout "B" originally intended for Friday on Sunday, or skip ahead to workout "A" on Monday?  If I choose the latter, should I use the exact weights I planned on using for Friday's workout, or assume all exercises were completed and passed on Friday and use increased weights for Monday?

I'm leaning towards skipping ahead to Monday's workout, using Friday's weights.  Regardless, I need to make sure I strictly adhere to my diet the coming days having missed a workout.

On a more positive note, I discovered that the local community college furnishes a proper gym with a full compliment of weight training equipment.  I will visit their gym soon to inquire about pricing.  The college gym is located considerably closer than Fitness 19.  If the price is right, I may switch.
