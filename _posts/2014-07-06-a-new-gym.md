An unusually slow 7 hour work shift yielded little in the way of exciting news worth writing about.  I paid a visit to Fitness 19 down the road after work.  Furnishing a proper squat rack and reasonable membership fees, I signed up with them on the spot.  Tomorrow will be the start of week 4 of Ice Cream Fitness 5x5.  I'll promptly terminate my membership with Snap Fitness after work.
