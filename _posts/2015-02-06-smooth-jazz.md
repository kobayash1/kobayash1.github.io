I happened to hear a track by the band four80east on the radio today.  It was back in high school when I was first introduced to music of the smooth jazz genre.  The track "Eastside" was the breakout hit that started the success of four80east in 1999.  The first time I heard "Eastside" was in the early 00's on WNUA 95.5.  The catchy bassline is what pulled me in.  The soulful solos kept me coming back for more.  This track is still very good and highly enjoyable for cruising on the open road.
