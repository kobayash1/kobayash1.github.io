I finally got a new pair of glasses today!  My last prescription was in 2010.  Those glasses broke a couple of months ago, so I've been using an even older pair (likely from 2005).  Earlier this year I did plenty of research on where to buy a new pair of sunglasses.  I still retain most of the information I gathered.  As a result, I already had a definite idea of what to look for in a new frame and where exactly to buy it.

Last Tuesday I visited the Warby Parker location in Chicago.  The store is located on a busy street among other clothing shops and boutique cafes.  It was my second time there (the first time was to shop for a pair of sunglasses), and one of the staff even recognized me, welcoming me back to the store.

I browsed all the different styles and tried on almost every pair in the showroom.  Eventually I narrowed it down to a select few when one of the friendly staff came over to help me out.  She noted that one frame I was considering in particular, the "Mitchell," fit my face well without bowing the arms outward.  I liked the color scheme and the fit on my head, so I settled on these.

After giving all the necessary information and having my eyes measured, I paid for my new glasses and declined the expedited processing for an extra fee.  The next day, I received an e-mail that my glasses were already being assembled.  By Friday, the glasses were shipped.  Initially, at the store, I was informed I would likely be receiving the eyeglasses on the 29th.  One week early isn't so bad!
