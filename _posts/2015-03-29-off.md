I can't remember the last time I had two consecutive days off work.  I don't know what to do!

Normally, I would have time to clean the house, do laundry, and iron clothes on my day off.  By the time I'm done with those, it's study time and perhaps a little extra for cooking.  I usually don't bother going out for fun because I'll have work the next day.  But since I'm off tomorrow with nothing much to do aside from my Monday workout, I'm debating whether to further recharge at home or find some place to watch this year's Wrestlemania.
