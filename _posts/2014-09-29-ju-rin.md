Week 16 started today after a drive thru shift at work.  I struggled again with the squats at 140 pounds, but I'm making noticeable prgress.  Hopefully by the end of the week I'll be able to push 145.

Hungry after a productive workout, I decided to try a local restaurant within the same complex as my gym.  Ju Rin is a sushi and teppanyaki restaurant offering authentic Japanese fare.  Not knowing much about it, the nondescript outside appearance of the restaurant never quite pulled me in for a curious look.  The windows into the restaurant are tall, narrow, and blocked by neon signs of different beers offered, Kirin among them.  The impression I developed of Ju Rin from passing by it every trip to my gym was that it was a small and casual dive.

When I stepped in, however, my expectations immediately exceeded.  First, there is more floor space in the restaurant that one would assume from looking at Ju Rin from outside.  The most prominent fixture of the restaurant upon entering would be the sushi conveyor.  Asking for a seat for one, I took a chair at the sushi bar.  There were many more tables available, and towards the wall opposite the sushi conveyor were the three teppans used by the chefs for live table-side cooking.  Today, I resolved myself to try their sushi offerings and take a seat at one of the teppans on my next visit.

The menu offered many standard rolls and the typical selection of nigiri.  Less common, however, was the availability of otoro (fatty tuna).  For tonight, I ordered some beef yaki soba and a few pieces of nigiri.  I'm no expert food critic, but overall, the food was delicious.  The yaki soba was flavorful and the otoro was decadent.  I'll definitely look forward to sampling their teppan offerings next time!
