Today after work, I had some necessary errands to run that involved me travelling to Oak Park.  After finishing up some business there, I headed to Logan Arcade in the Logan Square neighborhood of Chicago.  There I met my friend whom I bailed on two days ago to check out the recently opened barcade.  The place was just as my friend had described.  Plenty of retro arcade games available to play for just one quarter and a specialized and varied drink selection at the bar.

Close to 6 PM, I had arrived at a time of low capacity.  I toured the floor, perusing the game selection.  I recognized a few games from years past, but I really only found two games I wanted to play.  Both games, an indie arcade game called *Killer Queen* and classic fighting game *Street Fighter III: Third Strike*, are best enjoyed with other players.  However, since *Killer Queen* is best played with ten people, my friend and I played a lengthy set of *Third Strike*.

After I spent about $5 on the cabinet trying to finally solve all of my friend's gimmicky characters (and knocking off the rust from my game), we left for a food run at a local bar and grill.  Upon returning from dinner, Logan Arcade was packed!  We had no problems collecting ten people to participate in games of *Killer Queen*, and a small crew of regular Friday night *Third Strike* players were huddled around the cabinet.  After finally trying out *Killer Queen* (an amazing game, if you ask me), I hopped on the SF3 cabinet to test my mettle against the Logan Arcade crew.

Despite suffering a couple of losses to an Elena player, I had little trouble mounting a sizeable (8 wins) win streak.  Given that I'm not very good at *Third Strike*, these guys weren't anything special.  Their enthusiasm for the game, however, was very refreshing to see.  I could tell these players were of the new school that got started in competitive fighting games with *Street Fighter 4*, but seeing their dedication and enthusiasm to play this relic of the past was pleasantly surprising.

I wanted to play more, but I skipped out early due to a double shift at work tomorrow.  I'll definitely be back next Friday!  In the meantime, I'll need to fire up my 360 during the week to tighten up my skills with Yang and reacquaint myself with my secondary characters Ken and Urien.
