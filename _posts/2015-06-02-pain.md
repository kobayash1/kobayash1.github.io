I woke up this morning with a stiff neck.  Sharp pain originating in the left posterior side of my neck radiates all the way to the back of my left shoulder.  The full range of motion of my head is limited.  Turning a certain way, for example looking up or down, causes the pain to shoot up.  Keeping my head still doesn't produce any pain, but staying that way throughout the course of a full day is obviously impossible.

I hope the pain resides by tomorrow when I go to the gym and work afterwards.  Otherwise, life will be tough.
