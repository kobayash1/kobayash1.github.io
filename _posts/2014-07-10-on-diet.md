A few slices of cantaloupe served as a quick breakfast before rushing to work.  Between training the (sort of) new recruit and a hectic delivery day, there was nary a chance to catch a break.  Indeed, I continued working while on my scheduled break.  The uninterrupted flow of my shift prevented me from eating anything at all until after I clocked off.

Upon arriving home, I immediately drove straight to Plainfield for a necessary patient visit.  I stopped by on the return home for what was finally my first substantial meal of the day.  The time was minutes after six.

Despite my then ravenous appetite, I found myself adequately satisfied after the heavy near-1,000 calorie meal.  I easily succeeded at meeting my sub-2,000 daily caloric intake goal for today.  Days off work often prove a more difficult task to meet my diet goal.  Boredom cretes plenty of opportunity for my hunger to creep up from my sub-conscious.  However with the frenetic pace of work, I have literally no time to be hungry.

Perhaps my job is the best dietary supplement I am taking.
