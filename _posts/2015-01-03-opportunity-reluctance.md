A typical 8 hour shift at work today presented me with a great opportunity.  The day started off like any other.  In the middle of my morning prep, the general manager arrived to start her shift.  Not long after she had come in, she approached me.  "Chris, when you get a chance, maybe during your break, I'd like to talk to you."

Naturally, I obliged.  Until the time came for my lunch break, I wondered what exactly she would want to discuss with me in private.  I was slightly nervous about it, but I did my best to hide my anxiety.  My uneasiness was quickly dispelled when she revealed her machinations to promote me to hourly shift manager.  She outlined some of the benefits of becoming an HSM without really delving into much more detail about it.  She gave me "a few days" to consider her proposal.  I asked her only one question regarding my possible promotion, citing my resolution to stay in Elgin.

If I were to assume the HSM role, I don't want to relocate to another restaurant.  She did her best to allay my concerns without giving me a concrete answer.  Ultimately, where shift managers are delegated to serve is the decision of the area manager.  Recent shuffles of managers across several locations have led to numerous resignations causing havoc for our area manager.  And though these events may have given our relatively new area manager reason to hesitate with further relocations, they are no guarantee.

I haven't written about my colleague whom I admire in a long time, mostly because there's nothing new to write about.  I still have the same feelings about her as I did many months ago.  If anything has changed, my attraction has only increased.  Lately, however, I haven't interacted with her as much as I would normally.  The recent holiday rush that started in November and continued through December led to very busy shifts at work with little to no downtime.  Furthermore, I simply haven't been scheduled many shared shifts with her.  The last time we worked together was some time before Christmas Eve.

A couple of days ago, my general manager asked me if I would be willing to cover an 8 hour shift in Lombard for Sunday.  I was already scheduled a 6 hour morning shift for that day.  It would be the first time I could work with my colleague in almost two weeks.  Normally, I would jump at the opportunity to increase my hours, especially when I get reimbursed for my gasoline and travel time.  However, I declined.

The area manager happened to stop by the restaurant that day.  After speaking with him, my general manager came back to me almost begging me to take the Lombard shift.  I accepted begrudgingly.

Work is really the only interaction I have with my admired colleague.  Though I consider her more than just a co-worker, we don't interact with each other much off the clock.  She normally has a very busy schedule with little opportunity for social engagements, though I haven't tried asking her in a while.  (It's probably high time I try asking her to lunch or something.)

Thinking about my upward progression within the company reminded me of my current position as a regular staff member.  On most shifts, there's only one hourly shift manager on duty.  My promotion to HSM would mean I no longer work shifts with her.  And while I know feeling any kind of reluctance toward a job promotion simply because it would lead to less time spent with some girl I like is petty, I would be lying if I said the thought doesn't even come up in my head.

Ugh, speaking of my head, it hurts now.  Maybe I'm just overthinking shit.  Whatever, I need to go to bed.  I have a one hour commute to Lombard tomorrow morning.
