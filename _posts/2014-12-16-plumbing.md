Yesterday after my workout, I arrived home to a leaky kitchen sink drain.  The old trap set (which is what it is apparently called) finally developed enough cracks to start leaking.  This morning I removed the old trap set and basket and took the broken pieces with me to the local Home Depot.

In the plumbing aisle I was helped by a gentleman named Joe.  He claimed to be a plumber, and after showing him the broken parts and pictures of the setup underneath the sink, he directed me to the right equipment to buy.  With a quick rundown of the procedure I must follow for this repair, Joe wished me luck.  The grand total for the replacement parts came out to a staggering $27.

The process of replacing the trap set and basket was fairly straightforward.  I followed Joe's advice word-for-word and completed the job in under an hour.  I can't imagine how much a housecall from a proper plumber would have cost for what turned out to be a very easy repair!
