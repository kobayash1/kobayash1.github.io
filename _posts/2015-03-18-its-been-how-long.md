Week 40 began on Monday.  I skipped all the accessory lifts and only performed the main lifts.  I set a new personal record on the deadlift at 210 pounds, and I managed to pass (again) 155 pounds on the squat.  I deloaded, for one, because I couldn't complete 165 and also to allow myself to re-focus on my form.  I watched a couple of tutorials on the web to refresh my perspective on the squat and find flaws in my execution.

Normally after squats the brunt of the muscle fatigue is felt on my quadriceps.  With my (hopefully) improved from as of Monday, I felt much more activation in the glutes than ever before.  I'll continue trying to maintain this new form to see if it will help me finally break my 165 pound plateau.  Tomorrow (later today) will be the 160 pound squat.  If I can succeed, I'll try and slay the beast again on Friday.

At some point in the near future I want to reflect on my weight training motivation.  It's hard to believe 40 weeks have already passed since I started lifting.  My goals back when I started do not differ much at all compared to my goals now.  But throughout the course of all this time, my source of motivation has been anything but steady.  Despite my reasons for pursuing physical fitness, the one constant has been that I have managed to keep at this new lifestyle for 40 weeks and counting.  I'll take some time in the coming days to look back and gather my thoughts on the matter for a future post.
