Socialization is the concept of learning ideas that are not inherently natural.  It is a nurtured process.  Such ideas learned are the result of what the greater society finds worthy its citizens to adopt.  Ideas that one should not lie nor steal nor stand in front of a moving train are good ones for individuals to abide by if society is to grow and prosper.  Most of these lessons are taught at an early age, and most are beneficial if not necessary to our survival.  However, not all things learned through social practices are necessarily best for the individual.

In my research on self-improvement, a common theme is the idea that socialization implants ideals and motivations that, while beneficial to the greater good of society, are detrimental to the success of the individual.  Perhaps the most common and widespread misconceptions as a result of socialization are those instilled in young males as they pertain to female seduction.  It's all really fascinating stuff that I hope to fully develop my own opinions on to share on my blog.  I'll probably finish reading the current book I am on by the end of this week.
