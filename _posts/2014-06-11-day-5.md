It's shortly after midnight as of this writing.  Later on this morning, I'll be doing the fifth of five consecutive 8 hour shifts in five days.  Yesterday, I fell asleep about an hour after I arrived home at about 5.  I woke up just momentarily.  

I guess I'll eat a quick sandwich, read up on a little bit of news, and perhaps watch a podcast before going back to bed.  At least I'll have plenty of energy tomorrow with all this sleep I'm getting!
