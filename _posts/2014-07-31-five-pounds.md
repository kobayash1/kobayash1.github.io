It sure is fascinating how five pounds of weight can make a profound difference.  For yesterday's workout, I reduced the weight on the squat exercise from 125 to 120 pounds.  The difference in my form compared to Monday's workout was like night and day.  There were still a couple of reps I performed where my technique was less than optimal, but I'll take Friday as one more opportunity to re-tune my form before increasing back to 125 on Monday.

## Linux

I registered today to audit the free introductory linux course being offered by [edx.org](https://www.edx.org/course/linuxfoundationx/linuxfoundationx-lfs101x-introduction-1621).  Though I am familiar enough with the operating system to use it more efficiently than a novice, I never really went through any formal training to really introduce me to all the basics.  Since this is a $2,400 course being offered for free, I decided it would be well worth the time investment to undertake.  I'm sure there will be plenty of material I already know, but also certain that there will be even more things I do not.
