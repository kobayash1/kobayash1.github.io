Exactly six months ago I started weightlifting.  The bulk of my fat loss was concentrated in the first two or three months.  After that, the fat loss decreased while the muscle gains started to catch up.  I still have more progress to make in order to reach my fitness goal, but if someone would have told me a year ago that I would be in the shape I currently am I would have not believed them.

And to think I started all this just to try and impress this one girl at work...
