Finished the third of five straight 8 hour shifts today.  This one was pretty brutal.  I started 7:30, and got off at 4:10, without a break!  I was scheduled only for three hours today, but my colleague asked me to cover for him as he's been battling some illness.

Lately I've been thinking about purchasing a gym membership.  There's a gym within walking distance from my home.  My brother used to regularly visit his gym last year.  I can ask him about his workout regimen and probably adopt it for myself.  I'll look up the nearby Snap Fitness online and probably walk in tomorrow after work.
