Week 20 began yesterday with my B workout before a night shift at work.  I succeeded at all my exercises for the first time in weeks!  Perhaps this is a result of my increased diet and return to protein powder?  Tomorrow's workout should be telling, as I will increase the weights accordingly.

With today off, I took care of some lawn maintenance and made a quick mall run to purchase a sport coat for my friend's wedding in late November.  One day I'll buy a proper suit to keep in storage for such formal occasions.  Technically, I have the pieces necessary to create an appropriate ensemble for the wedding.  However, the last pair of dress pants I bought was in May--one month before I began my weight training.  Those pants, measuring 36 inches at the waist, fit me perfectly at the time of purchase.  But as of two weeks ago...
