An early morning visit with a patient in Plainfield was proceeded by yard work.  After cutting down some wild trees in the backyard, mowing the lawn was the next order.  Despite completing the task in less time than it normally requires of me, I still had plenty of energy and had barely broken a sweat.  Fortunate was I as today was a workout day.

The third and final workout of week 3 in my training was special.  I travelled to Conviction Fitness in the Lincoln Square neighborhood of Chicago.  Here, I would spend a training session with my mentor Yosh.  We spent plenty of time discussing various fitness topics throughout the day.  Yosh was also kind enough to critique my form in the different exercises I executed today and strongly suggested I stop using the Smith fixed-press machine at my current gym for many reasons.  I took every opportunity to glean as much information from him as possible.  I definitely feel I have learned plenty today that will help me achieve my fitness goals even more efficiently.  Indeed I am very fortunate and grateful to have him be an instrumental part of my success in fitness.

Needless to say, after all the rigorous activity, I sit exhausted at my desktop early in the evening.  A long period of sleep is definitely in order for tonight.  Tomorrow I will begin my search for a proper gym that furnishes power racks instead of Smith presses.
