The engine lamp on my car's dashboard has been on for the past week or so.  I got the engine code from a local parts store the day it came on.  Signals pointed to either an oxygen sensor or converter issue.  Over the weekend, I visited my mechanic to diagnose the problem.  It turned out to be a faulty catalytic converter.  I purchased the part Sunday night from Advance immediately after work.  Shortly after leaving the parking lot, my car warned me that it was time for an oil change!

Normally, I get my oil changed at the dealership.  They use a synthetic blend oil for regular tune ups.  However, since I was already bringing my car to the mechanic on Tuesday, I figured I would take the opportunity to buy premium full synthetic oil and oil stabilizer from Walmart.  Yesterday before work, I purchased the oil, filter, stabilizer, and also finally got a haircut before starting my shift.

Today, I visited the shop early this morning to meet my 10 AM start time.  The catalytic converters on my car are welded to the exhaust pipes.  My mechanic had to saw the old converter out and weld the new one on.  Despite the extensive work (and the oil change) I was billed a paltry $80 in labor.  I'm sure if I had the same procedure performed at the dealership, my wallet would be significantly lighter.

## Fitness

Filling in for a night time server shift after my scheduled one yesterday forced me to postpone the beginning of Week 15 to today.  I dominated today's workout, and I can't wait to hit the weights on Thursday!
