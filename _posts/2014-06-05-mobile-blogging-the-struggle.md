I really want to be able to publish new posts to my blog from anywhere.

Maybe I was spoiled by the WordPress Android app, but I'm spending a lot of time on the Internet searching for a way to make this feasible.  Thus far, the only solution I can think of is to SSH into my desktop via JuiceSSH, and use Dropbox or BitTorrent Sync to transfer the necessary files.  I will find a way!
