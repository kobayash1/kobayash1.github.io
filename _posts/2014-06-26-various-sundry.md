I awoke this morning with some residual pain in my left quadricep.  It's a sharp localized pain that occurs when I lift my knee at an angle away from my forward axis.  I hope it won't carry over into tomorrow, else I may have difficulty performing squats.

Yesterday, I received in the mail my new shaker bottle I purchased from [bodybuilding.com](http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/musclepharm/shaker-bottle.html).  My first chance to use it properly will be tomorrow.

Today was the first time I tasted the southwest salad from McDonald's.  It was surprisingly pleasant and only 450 calories.  I can definitely get accustomed to ordering it should I need to find some quick food on the go.
