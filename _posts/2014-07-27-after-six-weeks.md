Exactly six weeks have passed since I started my weight training program.  I have not skipped a workout once, and I continue to complete most of the various exercises.  Just before starting my workout regimen, I took a picture of myself for reference.  I am using it as a point of comparison to where I am today.  I have made considerable progress in as little as six weeks, and I cannot wait to see my status after another six.
