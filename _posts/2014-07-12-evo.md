With the final workout of week 4 finishing yesterday, I am starting to notice minute changes in my physique.  I didn't forget to take a picture of myself before starting my training.  Perhaps I will do a before and after comparison in the future.

## Games

This weekend is Evolution 2014.  I haven't attended EVO since 2010, but I never miss the live stream.  With the imminent release of *Persona 4 Arena Ultimax*, I am taking the possibility of competing at next year's EVO into serious consideration.  I spent all night permanently affixed to my monitor after dinner, watching the *Ultra Street Fighter 4* tournament.  What started as a field of nearly 2,000 players was whittled down to just 8 over the course of one day.  The final 8 competitors remaining will face off Sunday.  Thankfully, I had the foresight to request off work tomorrow so I can do nothing but watch EVO!
