My left ear is a little different from the left ears of most people.  It's doubly more valuable to me than to most.  That's because if most people had lost hearing in their left ear, they would still be able to hear through the right.  I cannot.

I lost hearing in my right ear at a very young age.  I think I was in second grade when I came down with a nasty ear infection.  A visit to the hospital and multiple visits with otolaryngologists later, my right ear could no longer function.  I never really understood why it happened.  I was told it was a genetic defect possibly involving my right organ of Corti.  Of course I never fully understood everything being so young at the time.  And because I lost that hearing so long ago, I don't really remember what it's like to hear with two ears.

Slightly aurally handicapped, I have more trouble with normal functions than the average person.  Much to the visible and tangible (but not explicit) annoyance of the people I interact with, I ask others to repeat themselves more so than most people.  My spatial hearing is naturally off-kilter.  Everything sounds like it's coming from my left.  Not having two ears also leads to a decreased ability to properly hear others in conversation.  Many times I'll position myself to the right side of whomever I am talking to in an effort to help mitigate this problem.  Otherwise, I have to awkwardly turn the left side of my head towards the other person.  These complications become magnified in noisy environments.  This includes but is not limited to malls, cars with the window open/music on (especially if I'm the one driving), bars, arcades, and... work.

Typically on my shifts, I wear headset.  The headset is used to listen to customer orders and communicate with other team members.  The headset has one speaker, designed to leave the other ear unobstructed.  Naturally, I wear the headset on my only functioning side, affecting my ability to hear anything outside of the headset clearly and accurately.  This puts me in a very common situation where I have a customer speaking on the headset, overhead fans and other loud appliances continuously humming, and other front-of-house employees dictating further orders at me.

Needless to say, the commonly occurring situation creates frustration and impatience among my colleagues.  Last night, at one particularly busy point in the shift, I missed hearing an order from one of the servers.  He inquired me about the status of the order shortly afterward.  I responded, saying I didn't even hear him ask.  The rest of the night, he delivered all further orders to me in a *much higher* volume than normal.  Though I did appreciate that I could finally hear his normally soft voice, his sense of annoyance was very real and tangible through his tone and body language.

I can't blame him.  I would probably start to feel impatient dealing with myself, too.  I just have to suck it up and try harder.
