I forget what week it is in terms of my weight training.  I'll figure it out later when I update my spreadsheet.  I haven't neglected my workouts, though!  Today was a particularly gruelling one, as I decided to do almost all of my accessory lifts in one session.  Today alone I completed:

- Squats
- Bench presses
- Bent over rows
- Dumbbell curls
- Face pulls
- Tricep extensions
- Planks
- Shrugs
- Lateral side raises

I think the only ones I didn't perform today were the glute bridges and close grip bench presses.  I'm so tired!  Hopefully I'm not overwhelmingly sore tomorrow!
