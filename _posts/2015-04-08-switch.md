I've been doing Ice Cream Fitness now since June of last year.  When I was texting my friend back and forth at the gym yesterday, he suggested I try switching my current training regimen.  One program he offered was Jim Wendler's 5/3/1.

I've spent the better part of this morning researching 5/3/1.  It is a good program with a focus on strength building using four main lifts:  squat, bench press, deadlift, and overhead press.  It utilizes the same main lifts as Ice Cream Fitness, but it eliminates much of the accessory work and has a different weight progression.  In ICF, the weights used in the core lifts rarely change much.  You lift heavier than you lifted in the last session or you use the same weight.  Wendler's program changes the weights depending on the week and your current one rep max.  The one rep max will change after a 4 week period.  Likely, it will increase.

There's more details to the workout, but it's fairly simple.  I'll create a new spreadsheet for myself this week and start 5/3/1 on Monday.  I can't wait to try this one out!  I do, however, need to figure out some one rep maxes sometime this week.
